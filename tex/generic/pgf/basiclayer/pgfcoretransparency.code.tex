% Declares a new fading based on the contents of a box.
%
% #1 = name of the fading
% #2 = content of a TeX box that specifies the fading
%
% Description:
%
% This command declares a new fading based on the contents of
% the TeX box. The mask can later be used to mask other graphics.
%
% The box is used to determine where the mask is opaque: At the
% beginning, the mask is completely transparent. Wherever the box
% contains something (like text or a picture or whatever), the
% luminosity of the text/graphic is used to determine how opaque the
% point will be. The greater the luminosity, the more opaque. The net
% effect is that white corresponds to "completely opaque" and black to
% "completely transparent". This is rather counterintuitive. Because
% of this, the special color "pgftransparent" is defined, which is the
% same as black. By setting the color to, say,
% \color{pgftransparent!10} you get something that is 10% transparent
% and \color{pgftransparent!90} gives you 90% transparency.
%
% By default, the drawing color is set to opaque.
%
% Example:
%
% \pgfdeclarefading{mymask}{
%  \fontsize{200}{200}\bfseries
%  Ti\emph{k}Z
% }
% \pgfdeclarefading{myothermask}{
%  \tikz \shade [left color=transparent,right color=transparent!0]
%    (0,0) rectangle (5,5);
% }

% Use a previously declared fading.
%
% #1 = name of the fading
% #2 = transformation code
%
% Description:
%
% The command should be used *inside* a pgfpicture to install a
% fading. The fading is a part of the graphic state. (This command
% works much like \pgfsetstrokeopacity).
%
% The mask will be centered on the origin. The transformation code #2 is
% applied to the mask (but not the contents of the actual picture).

% Use a previously declared fading scaled for the current path.
%
% #1 - an fading
% #2 - extra transformations
%
% Description:
%
% This command works a bit like \pgfshadepath. "Works a bit like"
% means the following: The masks's original size should
% completely cover the area between (0,0) and (100bp,100bp). The
% mask is then rescaled so that it completely covers the path. Then
% the additional transformation #2 is applied. Finally, the mask is
% made part of the graphic state (as with \pgfsetfading). The path
% used for computation purposes only -- it is not drawn or otherwise
% used.
%
% If no transformations occur, the lower left corner of the path will
% lie on (25bp, 25bp), the upper right corner on (75bp, 75bp).
%
% If the path was empty, the fading will be used at its natural size,
% centered on the origin.
%
% Example:
%
% \pgfdeclarefading{fade right}
% {\tikz[left color=transparent!0,right color=transparent!100]
%    (0,0) rectangle (100bp,100bp);}
%
% \pgfpathmoveto{\pgforigin}
% \pgfpathlineto{\pgfxy(1,0)}
% \pgfpathlineto{\pgfxy(1,1)}
% \pgfsetfadingforcurrentpath{fade right}{}
% \pgfusepath{fill}

% Group things in a a transparency group
%
% Description:
%
% This takes groups pgf commands inside a pgfpicture in a transparency
% group. This means that any transparency settings apply to commands a
% whole. For instance, if a box contains two overlapping black
% circles and you draw them normally with 50% transparency, then the
% overlap will be darker than the rest. By comparison, if the circles
% are part of a transparency group, the overlap will get the same
% color as the rest.
