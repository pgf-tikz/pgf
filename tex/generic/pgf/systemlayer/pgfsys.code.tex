% In the following dummy definitions of the pgf system commands are

% preferably all of them. If some system command is used that has not
% been overwritten, the command fails with a warning.
%
% In some cases, some pgf system commands are just shorthands for a
% series of more complicated commands. In this case, a default
% implementation is given in this file, but a driver may choose to
% overwrite this default implementation with a more efficient
% version. For example, a closestroke is the same as a closepath
% followed by a stroking, but in pdf there is a special shorthand for
% this. So, the pdf driver overwrites \pgfsys@closestroke, while the
% postscript driver does not.
%
% The commands for which default implementations are available are

%
% Invocation commands
%

\def\pgfsys@invoke{\pgf@sys@fail{invoking specials}}
% This command is used whenever some literal text needs to be inserted
% into the resulting .pdf, .ps, or .dvi file. Note that most
% \pgfsys@xxxx commands will not directly call this command, but,
% rather, use the protocolling mechanism to record their literal
% text. It is then left to the discretion of the protocolling
% mechanism to insert the literal text at some appropriate, later
% time.
%
% This command should only be called when \pgfsys@beginpicture has
% been called previously and when the picture has not been suspended
% using \pgfsys@beginhbox.

\def\pgfsys@outerinvoke{\pgfsys@invoke}
% This command can be used to insert protocolled graphic commands
% outside any picture. This is extremely dangerous, but sometimes
% useful. By default, this command does the same as inside pictures.



%
%
% Path construction commands
%
%

\def\pgfsys@moveto#1#2{\pgf@sys@fail{path constructions}}
% This command is used to start a path at a specific point (#1,#2)
% or to move the current point of the current path to (#1,#2)
% without drawing anything upon stroking (the current path is
% `interrupted').
%
% The arguments must be dimensions (like |10pt|).
%
% Example:
%
% \pgfsys@moveto{10pt}{10pt}
% \pgfsys@lineto{0pt}{0pt}
% \pgfsys@stroke
%
% This will draw a line from (10pt,10pt) to the origin of the picture.

\def\pgfsys@lineto#1#2{\pgf@sys@fail{path constructions}}
% Continue the current path to (#1,#2) with a line.

\def\pgfsys@curveto#1#2#3#4#5#6{\pgf@sys@fail{path constructions}}
% Continue the current path with a bezier curve to (#5,#6). The
% control points of the curve are at (#1,#2) and (#3,#4).

\def\pgfsys@rect#1#2#3#4{\pgf@sys@fail{path constructions}}
% Append a rectangle to the current path whose lower left corner is at
% (#1,#2) and whose width/height is given by (#3,#4).
%
% This command can be `mapped back' to moveto and lineto commands, but
% it is included since pdf has a special, quick version of this command.

\def\pgfsys@closepath{\pgf@sys@fail{path constructions}}
% Close the current path. This results in joining the current point of
% the path with the point specified by the last moveto
% operation. Typically, this is preferable over using lineto to the
% last point specified by a moveto, since the line starting at this
% point and the line ending at this point will be smoothly joined by
% closepath.
%
% Example:
%
% \pgfsys@moveto{0}{0}
% \pgfsys@lineto{10}{10}
% \pgfsys@lineto{0}{10}
% \pgfsys@closepath
% \pgfsys@stroke
%
% versus
%
% \pgfsys@moveto{0}{0}
% \pgfsys@lineto{10}{10}
% \pgfsys@lineto{0}{10}
% \pgfsys@lineto{0}{0}
% \pgfsys@stroke
%
% The difference between the above will be that in the second triangle
% the corner at the origin will be wrong; it will just be the overlay
% of two lines going in different directions, not a sharp pointed
% corner.






%
%
% Stroking and filling commands
%
%

\def\pgfsys@stroke{\pgf@sys@fail{path usage}}
% Stroke the current path (as if it were drawn with a pen). A number
% of so-called graphic state parameters influence this, which can be
% set in different ways:
%
% - linewidth
%   The `thickness' of the line. A width of 0 is the thinnest width
%   renderable on the device. On a high-resolution printer this may
%   become invisible and should be avoided. A good choice is 0.4pt,
%   which is the default.
%
% - stroke color
%   This special color is used for stroking. If it is not set, the
%   current color is used.
%
% - cap
%   The cap describes how the endings of lines a drawn. A round cap
%   adds a little half circle to these endings. A butt cap ends the
%   lines exactly at the end (or start) point without anything
%   added. A rectangular cap ends the lines like the butt cap, but the
%   lines protrude over the endpoint by the line thickness. (See also
%   the pdf or postscript manual). If the path has been closed, no cap
%   is drawn.
%
% - join
%   This describes how a bend (a join) in a path is rendered. A round
%   join draws bends using small arcs. A bevel join just draws the two
%   lines and then fills the join minimally so that it becomes
%   convex. A miter join extends the lines so that they form a single
%   sharp corner, but only up to a certain miter limit. (See the pdf
%   or postscript manual once more).
%
% - dash
%   The line may be dashed according to a dashing pattern.
%
% - clipping area
%   If a clipping area is established, only those parts of the path
%   that are inside the clipping area will be drawn.
%
% In addition to stroking a path, the path may also be used for
% clipping after it has been stroked. This will happen if the
% \pgfsys@clipnext is used prior to this command, see there for
% details.

\def\pgfsys@fill{\pgf@sys@fail{path usage}}
% This command fills the area surrounded by the current path. If the
% path has not yet been closed, it is closed prior to filling. The
% path itself is not stroked. For self-intersecting paths or paths
% consisting of multiple parts, the nonzero winding number rule is
% used to determine whether a point is inside or outside the
% path, except if \ifpgfsys@eorule holds -- in which case the even-odd
% rule should be used. (See the pdf or postscript manual for details.)
%
% The following graphic state parameters influence the filling:
%
% - fill color
%   If the fill color is not especially set, the current color is
%   used.
%
% - clipping area
%   If a clipping area is established, only those parts of the filling
%   area that are inside the clipping area will be drawn.
%
% In addition to filling the path, the path will also be used for
% clipping if \pgfsys@clipnext is used prior to this command.

\def\pgfsys@fillstroke{\pgf@sys@fail{path usage}}
% First, the path is filled, then the path is stroked. If the fill and
% stroke colors are the same (or if they are not specified and the
% current color is used), this yields almost the same as a
% \pgfsys@fill. However, due to the line thickness of the stroked
% path, the fillstroked area will be slightly larger.
%
% In addition to stroking and filling the path, the path will also be
% used for clipping if \pgfsys@clipnext is used prior to this command.

\def\pgfsys@clipnext{\pgf@sys@fail{path usage}}
% This command should be issued after a path has been constructed, but
% before it has been stroked and/or filled or discarded. When the
% command is used, the next stroking/filling/discarding command will
% first be executed normally. Then, afterwards, the just-used path
% will be used for subsequent clipping. If there has already been a
% clipping region, this region is intersected with the new clipping
% path (the clipping cannot get bigger). The nonzero winding number
% rule is used to determine whether a point is inside or outside the
% clipping area or the even-odd rule, depending on whether
% \ifpgfsys@eorule holds.

\def\pgfsys@discardpath{\pgf@sys@fail{path usage}}
% Normally, this command should `throw away' the current path.
% However, after \pgfsys@clipnext has been called, the current path
% should subsequently be used for clipping. See \pgfsys@clipnext for
% details.

\def\pgfsys@closestroke{\pgfsys@closepath\pgfsys@stroke}
% This command should have the same effect as first closing the path
% and then stroking it.

\newif\ifpgfsys@eorule
% Decides, whether even-odd filling and clipping is
% to be used or normal the non-zero winding number rule. See the
% pdf-documentation for details on what these rules are.




%
%
% Stroking options
%
%
\def\pgfsys@setlinewidth#1{\pgf@sys@fail{setting the line width}}
% Sets the width of lines, when stroked, to #1, which must be a TeX
% dimension (as text).

\def\pgfsys@buttcap{\pgf@sys@fail{setting the line cap}}
% Sets the cap to a butt cap. See \pgfsys@stroke.

\def\pgfsys@roundcap{\pgf@sys@fail{setting the line cap}}
% Sets the cap to a round cap. See \pgfsys@stroke.

\def\pgfsys@rectcap{\pgf@sys@fail{setting the line cap}}
% Sets the cap to a rectangular cap. See \pgfsys@stroke.

\def\pgfsys@miterjoin{\pgf@sys@fail{setting the line join}}
% Sets the join to a miter join. See \pgfsys@stroke.

\def\pgfsys@setmiterlimit#1{\pgf@sys@fail{setting the line cap}}
% Sets the miter limit of lines to #1. See the pdf or postscript
% documentation.

\def\pgfsys@roundjoin{\pgf@sys@fail{setting the line cap}}
% Sets the join to a round join. See \pgfsys@stroke.

\def\pgfsys@beveljoin{\pgf@sys@fail{setting the line cap}}
% Sets the join to a bevel join. See \pgfsys@stroke.

\def\pgfsys@setdash#1#2{\pgf@sys@fail{setting the dashing pattern}}
% Sets the dashing patter. #1 should be a list of lengths separated by
% commas. #2 should be a single dimension.
%
% The list of values in #1 is used to determine the lengths of the
% `on' phases of the dashing and of the `off' phases. For example, if
% #1 is `3pt,4pt', then the dashing pattern is `3pt on followed by 4pt
% off, followed by 3pt on, followed by 4pt off, and so on'. A pattern
% of `.5pt,4pt,3pt,1.5pt' means `.5pt on, 4pt off, 3pt on, 1.5pt off, .5pt on,
% ...'. If the number of entries is odd, the last one is used twice,
% so `3pt' means `3pt on, 3pt off, 3pt on, 3pt off,...'. An empty list
% means `always on'.
%
% The second argument determines the `phase' of the pattern. For
% example, for a pattern of `3pt,4pt' and a phase of `1pt', the pattern
% would start: `2pt on, 4pt off, 3pt on, 4pt off, 3pt on, 4pt off...'.

% Color stuff
%
%

\def\pgfsys@color@rgb@stroke#1#2#3{\pgf@sys@fail{color}}
% Sets the color used for stroking operations to the given rgb tuple
% (numbers between 0 and 1).
%
% Example: Make stroked text dark red: \pgfsys@color@rgb@stroke{0.5}{0}{0}
%
% The special stroking color is only used if the stroking color has
% been set since the last \pgfutil@color command. Thus, each \pgfutil@color command
% should reset both the stroking and filling colors.

\def\pgfsys@color@rgb@fill#1#2#3{\pgf@sys@fail{color}}
% Sets the color used for filling operations to the given rgb tuple
% (numbers between 0 and 1). This color may be different from the

\def\pgfsys@color@rgb#1#2#3{\pgfsys@color@rgb@stroke{#1}{#2}{#3}\pgfsys@color@rgb@fill{#1}{#2}{#3}}
% Sets the color used for filling and stroking operations. This is a

% Sets the color used for filling and stroking operations.

\def\pgfsys@color@cmy@stroke#1#2#3{\pgf@sys@fail{color}}
% Sets the color used for stroking operations to the given cym tuple

\def\pgfsys@color@cmy@fill#1#2#3{\pgf@sys@fail{color}}
% Sets the color used for filling operations to the given cym tuple

\def\pgfsys@color@cmy#1#2#3{\pgfsys@color@cmy@stroke{#1}{#2}{#3}\pgfsys@color@cmy@fill{#1}{#2}{#3}}
% Sets the color used for filling and stroking operations.

\def\pgfsys@color@gray@stroke#1{\pgf@sys@fail{color}}
% Sets the color used for stroking operations to the given gray level
% (number between 0 and 1).

\def\pgfsys@color@gray@fill#1{\pgf@sys@fail{color}}

% (number between 0 and 1).

\def\pgfsys@color@gray#1{\pgfsys@color@gray@stroke{#1}\pgfsys@color@gray@fill{#1}}
% Sets the color used for filling and stroking operations.

\newif\ifpgfsys@color@reset@inorder
% This if decides whether the color resetting of the
% \pgfsys@color@reset command may assume that all color commands are
% given ``in order.'' This means that this command will not be called,

% where a fill color was actively set. This may allow the command to
% produce more compact code when it ``knows'' that no special fill or
% stroke color has been set.
\pgfsys@color@reset@inordertrue


\def\pgfsys@color@reset{}
% This command will be called when the \pgfutil@color command is used. It
% should purge any internal settings of stroking and filling
% color. After this call, till the next use of a command like
% \pgfsys@color@rgb@fill, the current color installed by the \pgfutil@color
% command should be used.

\def\pgfsys@color@unstacked#1{}
% This slightly obscure command causes the color stack to be

% #1 without causing any change in the color stack.

\def\pgfsys@text@to@black@hook{}
% Another slightly obscure command that allows tikz to hack into

%
% Coordinate system transformations
%
%

\def\pgfsys@transformcm#1#2#3#4#5#6{\pgf@sys@fail{transformations}}
% Perform a concatenation of the low-level current transformation

\def\pgfsys@transformshift#1#2{\pgfsys@transformcm{1}{0}{0}{1}{#1}{#2}}
% This command will change the origin of the low-level coordinate

\def\pgfsys@transformxyscale#1#2{\pgfsys@transformcm{#1}{0}{0}{#2}{0bp}{0bp}}
% This command will scale the low-level coordinate system (and
% everything that is drawn) by a factor of #1 in x-directed and #2 in
% y-direction. Note that this applies to everything, including
% lines. So a scaled line will have a different width and may even
% have a different width when going along the x-axis and when going

\def\pgfsys@viewboxmeet#1#2#3#4#5#6#7#8{\pgfsys@beginscope\pgf@sys@default@viewbox@impl{#1}{#2}{#3}{#4}{#5}{#6}{#7}{#8}{<}}

% Transparency
%
%

\def\pgfsys@opacity#1{\pgfsys@stroke@opacity{#1}\pgfsys@fill@opacity{#1}}
% Ideally, this should sets the opacity of all operations, treating
% the group as a transparency group with 1 meaning fully opaque, 0
% meaning fully transparent. Since most drivers do not support this,
% the fallback is to set the stroke and fill opacity at the same
% time. This is not quite the same, however.

\def\pgfsys@stroke@opacity#1{\pgf@sys@fail{opacity}}
% Sets the opacity of stroking operations. 1 means fully opaque, 0
% means fully transparent.

\def\pgfsys@fill@opacity#1{\pgf@sys@fail{opacity}}
% Sets the opacity of filling operations. 1 means fully opaque, 0
% means fully transparent.

\def\pgfsys@transparencygroupfrombox#1{\pgf@sys@fail{transparency groups}}
% This takes a TeX box and converts it into a transparency
% group. This means that any transparency settings apply to the box as
% a whole. For instance, if a box contains two overlapping black
% circles and you draw them normally with 50% transparency, then the
% overlap will be darker than the rest. By comparison, if the circles
% are part of a transparency group, the overlap will get the same
% color as the rest.
%
% The following settings modify the behaviour of a transparency group:

\newif\ifpgfsys@transparency@group@isolated
\newif\ifpgfsys@transparency@group@knockout


\def\pgfsys@blend@mode#1{\pgf@sys@fail{blend mode}}
% Sets the current blend mode. See the PDF specification for details
% on blend modes.


\def\pgfsys@definemask{\pgf@sys@fail{image masks}}
% This command declares a mask for usage with images. It works similar
% to \pgfsys@defineimage: Certain macros are set when the command is
% called. The result should be to set the macro \pgf@mask to a pdf
% object count that can subsequently be used as a soft mask. The
% following macros will be set when this command is invoked:
%
% - \pgf@filename
%   File name of the mask to be defined.
%
% - \pgf@maskmatte
%   The so-called matte of the mask (see the pdf documentation for
%   details). The matte is a color specification consisting of 1, 3 or
%   4 numbers between 0 and 1. The number of numbers depends on the
%   number of color channels in the image (not in the mask!). It will
%   be assumed that the image has been preblended with this color.

\def\pgfsys@fadingfrombox#1#2{\pgf@sys@fail{fadings}}
% Declares an fading named #1. The parameter #2 must be a
% box. Its contents luminosity determines the opacity of the resulting
% mask.

\def\pgfsys@usefading#1#2#3#4#5#6#7{\pgf@sys@fail{fadings}}

% Shading commands
%
%

\def\pgfsys@horishading#1#2#3{\pgf@sys@fail{shadings}\pgf@sys@noshading{#1}}
% Declares a horizontal shading for later use. The effect of this
% command should be the definition of a macro called `@pgfshading#1!'
% (or \csname @pdfshading#1!\endcsname, to be precise). When invoked,
% this new macro should insert a shading at the current position.
%
% #1 is the name of the shading, which is also used in the output
% macro name. #2 is the height of the shading and must be given as a
% TeX dimension like `2cm' or `10pt'. #3 is a shading color
% specification as specified in the pgfuserguide. The shading
% specification implicitly fixes the width of the shading.
%
% When `@pgfshading#1!' is invoked, it should insert a box of height
% #2 and the width implicit in the shading declaration.

\def\pgfsys@vertshading#1#2#3{\pgf@sys@fail{shadings}\pgf@sys@noshading{#1}}
% Like horishading, only for vertical shadings. This time, the height
% of the shading is implicit in #3 and the width is given as #2.

\def\pgfsys@radialshading#1#2#3{\pgf@sys@fail{shadings}\pgf@sys@noshading{#1}}
% Declares a radial shading. Like the previous macros, this command
% should setup the macro `@pgfshading#1!', which upon invocation
% should insert a radial shading whose size is implicit in #3.
%
% The parameter #2 is a pgf point specification if the starting point
% of the shading. See the pgfuserguide for details.

\def\pgfsys@functionalshading#1#2#3#4{\pgf@sys@fail{shadings (functional)}\pgf@sys@noshading{#1}}
% Declares a shading using a PostScript-like function that provides a
% color for each point. Like the previous macros, this command
% should setup the macro `@pgfshading#1!' so that it will produce a
% box containing the desired shading.
%
% Parameter #1 is the name of the shading. Parameter #4 is a
% Postscript-like function (type 4 function of the PDF specification)
% as described in Section 3.9.4 of the PDF Specification version 1.7.
% Parameter #2 and #3 are pgf point specifications that specifies the
% lower left and upper right coordinate.
%
% When function #4 is evaluated, the coordinate of the current
% point will be on the (virtual) PostScript stack in bp units. After
% the function has been evaluated, the stack should consist of three
% numbers (not integers! - the Apple PDF renderer is broken in this
% regard, so add cvr's at the end if needed) that represent the red,
% green, and blue components of the color.
%
% A buggy #4 will result is *totally unpredictable chaos* during
% rendering.

% #1       = name of the pattern (must be a plain suffix for use in

\def\pgfsys@setpatternuncolored#1#2#3#4{\pgf@sys@fail{patterns}}

% Animations
%
%


\newif\ifpgfsysanimationsupported
% Will be set to true by a driver when animations are supported. Note
% that snapshots are always supported.


\def\pgfsys@animate#1{\pgf@sys@fail{animations}}
% Adds an animation of the attribute #1 to the current scope.
% The configuration of the animation (like start times, etc.) is taken
% from the current values of the animation keys, which are configured
% using calls to \pgfsys@animation@..., which setup an animation
% key for the local scope. This means that you typically setup these
% keys in a scope and at the end of the scope call \pgfsys@animate.
%
% Some keys accumulate (like begin or keytime), most do not. In those
% cases, the last call overrides the previous one.
%
% Not all value types make sense or are allowed, it depends on the
% specific \pgfsys@animate call.
%
% Example:
%
% {
%   \pgfsys@animation@offset{10}{begin}%
%   \pgfsys@animation@event{}{click}{1}{begin}%
%   \pgfsys@animation@time{5}{1}{1}{0}{0}
%   \pgfsys@animation@val@scalar{1}
%   \pgfsys@animation@time{8}{1}{1}{0}{0}
%   \pgfsys@animation@val@scalar{0.5}
%   \pgfsys@animation@sum%
%   \pgfsys@animate{fillopacity}%
% }
%
% When a driver does not support a specific attribute #1, it should
% issue a \pgf@sys@fail. Typical attributes are things like "opacity"
% or "linewidth" or "dash".
%
% The following values are permissible for "#1":
%
% "opacity" adds an animation of the opacity.
% Type: scalar
%
% "fillopacity" adds an animation of the fill opacity.
% Type: scalar
%
% "strokeopacity" adds an animation of the stroke opacity.
% Type: scalar
%
% "visibility" adds an animation of the visibility.
% Type: text ("visible" or "hidden")
%
% "linewidth" adds an animation of the line width.
% Type: dimension
%
% "dash" adds an animation of the dash.
% Type: dash
%
% "translate" adds an animation of the transformation.
% Type: translate
%
% "scale" adds an animation of the transformation.
% Type: scale
%
% "rotate" adds an animation of the transformation.
% Type: scalar
%
% "skewx" adds an animation of the transformation.
% Type: scalar
%
% "skewy" adds an animation of the transformation.
% Type: scalar
%
% "motion" adds a movement along a path.
% Type: motion
%
% "strokecolor" adds an animation of the stroke color.
% Type: color
%
% "fillcolor" adds an animation of the fill color.
% Type: color
%
% "viewbox" adds an animation of the view box.
% Type: view box
%
% "path" adds an animation of the path to the path specified by
% \pgfsys@animation@whom
% Type: path
%
% "syncbase" adds a sync base to the animation. A sync base does not animate
% anything by itself, but other animations can begin and end relative
% to it.
%
% "none" suppresses the animation
% Type: any




% Animation timing :
%
% You specify an animation using a timeline. A timeline consists of a
% sequence of times together with values for these times. The times
% must be given in increasing order. You use the command
% \pgfsys@animation@time to specify a time and
% \pgfsys@animation@val@... to specify a value. The time must be
% specified first, the time--value is created when the value command is
% used.
%
% Times are given in seconds (so 0.01 is one hundredth of a second).
%
% The animation's timeline will start with the first time mentioned
% (not necessarily zero and not necessarily a positive value) and ends
% with the last value. The duration is the difference between these
% two values.

\def\pgfsys@animation@restart@always{}
% Specifies that the animation can always restart

\def\pgfsys@animation@restart@never{}
% Specifies that the animation should never restart

\def\pgfsys@animation@restart@whennotactive{}
% Specifies that the animation should only restart when it is not active

\def\pgfsys@animation@repeat#1{}
% #1 must be a number

\def\pgfsys@animation@repeat@indefinite{}
% Repeats forever

\def\pgfsys@animation@repeat@dur#1{}
% #1 must be a clock value

\def\pgfsys@animation@freezeatend{}
% Specifies that the last value of the animation remains in force at
% the end

\def\pgfsys@animation@removeatend{}
% Specifies that the effect of the animation is removed at the end

\def\pgfsys@animation@time#1#2#3#4#5{}
% Specifies a time together with spline control points for the entry
% and the exit to this time. The value #1 is a time in seconds (so 60
% means 1 minute, 0.001 means one millisecond). The values #2 and #3
% specify the control point of the spline *entering* the time point,
% while the values #4 and #5 specify the control point of the spline
% *leaving* the time point. They are all dimensionless values between
% 0 and 1. For a linear animation, set the first two to 1 and the last
% two to 0.
%
% Example:
% \pgfsys@animation@time{5}{1}{1}{0.25}{0.1}
% \pgfsys@animation@val@scalar{80}
% \pgfsys@animation@time{8}{.75}{1}{0}{0}
% \pgfsys@animation@val@scalar{90}
%
% In SVG, this will create the following entries:
% begin     = +5s
% duration  = 3s
% keyTimes  = 0;1
% values    = 80;90
% keySpline = 0.25 0.1 0.75 1
%
% For the key spline, note that the entry spline controls of the first
% time and the exit spline controls of the last point are dropped.
%
%
% When the exit spline takes the special values #4="stay" and #5="0",
% the attribute's value "stays" until the next value for the next time
% (it "jumps" to the next value then). This corresponds, roughly, to
% an "infinite" #4.
%
% Similarly, when the entry spline takes the special value #2="jump"
% and #3="1", the value immediately jumps from the previous value to
% the next value when the previous value was "created".

\def\pgfsys@stay@text{{stay}{0}}
\def\pgfsys@jump@text{{jump}{1}}

\def\pgfsys@animation@base{}
% Think of this command as setting the value of the attribute in the
% timeline before the timeline starts. Normally, an animation only
% influences the timeline while the animation is running (which may be
% forever) and before and after the animation is running, the
% attribute's value is not modified by the animation (so, it is just
% inherited from the surrounding scope). When a base value is set,
% while the animation is not running, this value is used. For most
% attributes you can achieve the same effect by surrounding the
% to-be-animated object by a scope and setting the value there, but
% using bases is often more convenient and, for instance for the
% visibility attribute, it is necessary to use a base.
%
% Note that when a backend driver does not support animations, base
% values will not be depicted unless a snapshot is used explicitly.

\def\pgfsys@animation@offset#1#2{}
% #1 must be a value in seconds, #2 is the target "begin" or "end" to
% which this offset is appended.

\def\pgfsys@animation@syncbegin#1#2#3#4{}
% #1 is the id of a sync base (obtained by
% \pgfsys@new@id), #2 is the id type (or empty), #3 is an optional
% offset, #4 is the target.

\def\pgfsys@animation@syncend#1#2#3#4{}
% Like the previous command.

\def\pgfsys@animation@event#1#2#3#4#5{}
% #1 is the optional id of another element (obtained by
% \pgfsys@new@id), #2 is the optional type of the id, #3 is an event
% name, #4 is an optional offset, #5 is the target.

\def\pgfsys@animation@repeat@event#1#2#3#4#5{}
% #1 is the optional id of another element, #2 is the type, #3 is a
% repeat count, and #4 is an optional offset, #5 is the target.

\def\pgfsys@animation@accesskey#1#2#3{}
% #1 is a character, #2 is an optional offset, #3 is the target.

\def\pgfsys@animation@canvas@transform#1#2{}
% #1 is some code that may call \pgfsys@transformcm at most once. It
% will be executed when a canvas transformation animation is
% installed for a scope id. #2 is some further codes that may also

% Called, when an image should be defined.
%
% This command does not take any parameters. Instead, certain macros
% will be preinstalled with appropriate values when this command is
% invoked. These are:
%
% - \pgf@filename
%   File name of the image to be defined.
%
% - \pgf@imagewidth
%   Will be set to the desired (scaled) width of the image.
%
% - \pgf@imageheight
%   Will be set to the desired (scaled) height of the image.
%
%   If this macro and also the height macro are empty, the image
%   should have its `natural' size.
%
%   If exactly only of them is specified, the undefined value the
%   image is scaled so that the aspect ratio is kept.
%
%   If both are set, the image is scaled in both directions
%   independently, possibly changing the aspect ratio.
%
%
% The following macros presumable mostly make sense for drivers that
% can handle pdf:
%
% - \pgf@imagepage
%   The desired page number to be extracted from a multi-page
%   `image'.
%
% - \pgf@imagemask
%   If set, it will be set to `/SMask x 0 R', where x is the pdf
%   object number of a soft mask to be applied to the image.
%
% - \pgf@imageinterpolate
%   If set, it will be set to `/Interpolate true' or  `/Interpolate
%   false', indicating whether the image should be interpolated in
%   pdf.
%
%
% The command should now setup the macro \pgf@image such that calling
% this macro will result in typesetting the image. Thus, \pgf@image is
% the `return value' of the command.
