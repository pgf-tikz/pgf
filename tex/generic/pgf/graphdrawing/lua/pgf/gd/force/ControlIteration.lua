    Depending on the characteristics of the input graph and the parameters
    chosen for the algorithm, minimizing the system energy may require
    many iterations.

    In these situations it may come in handy to limit the number of
    iterations. This feature can also be useful to draw the same graph
    after different iterations and thereby demonstrate how the spring or
    spring-electrical algorithm improves the drawing step by step.

    The examples shows two drawings generated using two
    different |iteration| limits.

    A small positive cooling factor
    $\ge 0$ means that the movement of nodes is quickly or abruptly
    reduced, while a large cooling factor $\le 1$ allows for a smoother
    step by step layout refinement at the cost of more iterations. The
    following example demonstrates how a smaller cooling factor may
    result in a less balanced drawing. By default, Hu2006 spring,
    Hu2006 spring electrical, and Walshaw2000 spring electrical use a
    cooling factor of |0.95|.
