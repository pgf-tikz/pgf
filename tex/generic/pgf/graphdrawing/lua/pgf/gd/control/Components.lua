-- @section subsection {Packing of Connected Components}
--
-- \label{subsection-gd-component-packing}
-- \label{section-gd-packing}
--
-- Graphs may be composed of subgraphs or \emph{components} that are not
-- connected to each other. In order to draw these nicely, most graph
-- drawing algorithms split them into separate graphs, compute
-- their layouts with the same graph drawing algorithm independently and,
-- in a postprocessing step, arrange them next to each other. Note,
-- however, that some graph drawing algorithms can also arrange the nodes
-- of the graph in a uniform way even for unconnected components (the
-- |simple necklace layout| is a case in point); for such algorithms you can
-- choose whether they should be applied to each component individually
-- or not (if not, the following options do not apply). To configure
-- which is the case, use the |componentwise| key.
--
-- The default method for placing the different components works as
-- follows:
-- %
-- \begin{enumerate}
--   \item For each component, a layout is determined and the component is
--     oriented as described
--     Section~\ref{subsection-library-graphdrawing-standard-orientation}
--     on the orientation of graphs.
--   \item The components are sorted as prescribed by the
--     |component order| key.
--   \item The first component is now placed (conceptually) at the
--     origin. (The final position of this and all other components will be
--     determined later, namely in the anchoring phase, but let us imagine
--     that the first component lies at the origin at this point.)
--   \item The second component is now positioned relative to the first
--     component. The ``direction'' in which the next component is placed
--     relative to the first one is determined by the |component direction|
--     key, so components can be placed from left to right or up to down or
--     in any other direction (even something like $30^\circ$). However,
--     both internally and in the following description, we assume that the
--     components are placed from left to right; other directions are
--     achieved by doing some (clever) rotating of the arrangement achieved
--     in this way.
--
--     So, we now wish to place the second component to the right of the
--     first component. The component is first shifted vertically according
--     to some alignment strategy. For instance, it can be shifted so that
--     the topmost node of the first component and the topmost node of the
--     second component have the same vertical position. Alternatively, we
--     might require that certain ``alignment nodes'' in both components
--     have the same vertical position. There are several other strategies,
--     which can be configured using the |component align| key.
--
--     One the vertical position has been fixed, the horizontal position is
--     computed. Here, two different strategies are available: First, image
--     rectangular bounding boxed to be drawn around both components. Then
--     we shift the second component such that the right border of the
--     bounding box of the first component touches the left border of the
--     bounding box of the second component. Instead of having the bounding
--     boxes ``touch'', we can also have a padding of |component sep|
--     between them. The second strategy is more involved and also known as
--     a ``skyline'' strategy, where (roughly) the components are
--     ``moved together as near as possible so that nodes do not touch''.
--   \item
--     After the second component has been placed, the third component is
--     considered and positioned relative to the second one, and so on.
--   \item
--     At the end, as hinted at earlier, the whole arrangement is rotate so
--     that instead of ``going right'' the component go in the direction of
--     |component direction|. Note, however, that this rotation applies only
--     to the ``shift'' of the components; the components themselves are
--     not rotated. Fortunately, this whole rotation process happens in the
--     background and the result is normally exactly what you would expect.
-- \end{enumerate}
--
-- In the following, we go over the different keys that can be used to
-- configure the component packing.
