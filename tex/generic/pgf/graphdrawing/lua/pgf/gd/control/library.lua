    Once a graph drawing algorithm has determined positions for the nodes,
    they are drawn \emph{before} the edges are drawn; after
    all, it is hard to draw an edge between nodes when their positions
    are not yet known. However, we typically want the nodes to be
    rendered \emph{after} or rather \emph{on top} of the edges. For
    this reason, the default behavior is that the nodes at their
    final positions are collected in a box that is inserted into the
    output stream only after the edges have been drawn -- which has
    the effect that the nodes will be placed ``on top'' of the
    edges.

    This behavior can be changed using this option. When the key is
    invoked, nodes are placed \emph{behind} the edges.
