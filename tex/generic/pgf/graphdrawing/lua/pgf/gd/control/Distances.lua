-- @section subsection {Padding and Node Distances}
--
-- \label{subsection-gd-dist-pad}
--
-- In many drawings, you may wish to specify how ``near'' two nodes should
-- be placed by a graph drawing algorithm. Naturally, this depends
-- strongly on the specifics of the algorithm, but there are a number of
-- general keys that will be used by many algorithms.
--
-- There are different kinds of objects for which you can specify
-- distances and paddings:
-- %
-- \begin{itemize}
--   \item You specify the ``natural'' distance between nodes
--     connected by an edge using |node distance|, which is also available in
--     normal \tikzname\ albeit for a slightly different purpose. However,
--     not every algorithm will (or can) honor the key; see the description
--     of each algorithm what it will ``make of this option''.
--   \item A number of graph drawing algorithms arrange nodes in layers
--     (or levels); we refer
--     to the nodes on the same layer as siblings (although, in a tree,
--     siblings are only nodes with the same parent; nevertheless we use
--     ``sibling'' loosely also for nodes that are more like ``cousins'').
--   \item When a graph consists of several connected component, many graph
--     drawing algorithms will layout these components individually. The
--     different components will then be arranged next to each other, see
--     Section~\ref{section-gd-packing} for the details, such that between
--     the nodes of any two components a padding is available.
-- \end{itemize}
