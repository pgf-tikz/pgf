-- \label{subsection-library-graphdrawing-standard-orientation}
--
-- Just as a graph drawing algorithm cannot know \emph{where} a graph
-- should be placed on a page, it is also often unclear which
-- \emph{orientation} it should have. Some graphs, like trees, have a
-- natural direction in which they ``grow'', but for an ``arbitrary''
-- graph the ``natural orientation'' is, well, arbitrary.
--
-- There are two ways in which you can specify an orientation: First,
-- you can specify that the line from a certain vertex to another
-- vertex should have a certain slope. How these vertices and slopes
-- are specified in explained momentarily. Second, you can specify a
-- so-called ``growth direction'' for trees.

    This key specifies that the straight line from the |orient tail| to
    the |orient head| should be at an angle of \meta{direction} relative to
    the right-going $x$-axis. Which vertices are used as tail an head
    depends on where the |orient| option is encountered: When used with
    an edge, the tail is the edge's tail and the head is the edge's
    head. When used with a node, the tail or the head must be specified
    explicitly and the node is used as the node missing in the
    specification. When used with a graph as a whole, both the head and
    tail nodes must be specified explicitly.

    Note that the \meta{direction} is independent of the actual to-path
    of an edge, which might define a bend or more complicated shapes. For
    instance, a \meta{angle} of |45| requests that the end node is ``up
    and right'' relative to the start node.

    You can also specify the standard direction texts |north| or |south east|
    and so forth as \meta{direction} and also |up|, |down|, |left|, and
    |right|. Also, you can specify |-| for ``right'' and \verb!|! for ``down''.

    This key specifies in which direction the neighbors of a node

    those that layout trees, but also for those that produce layered
    layouts, there is a natural direction in which the ``children'' of
    a node should be placed. For instance, saying |grow=down| will cause
    the children of a node in a tree to be placed in a left-to-right
    line below the node (as always, you can replace the \meta{angle}
    by direction texts). The children are requested to be placed in a
    counter-clockwise fashion, the |grow'| key will place them in a
    clockwise fashion.

    Note that when you say |grow=down|, it is not necessarily the case
    that any particular node is actually directly below the current
    node; the key just requests that the direction of growth is downward.

    In principle, you can specify the direction of growth for each node
    individually, but do not count on graph drawing algorithms to
    honor these wishes.
