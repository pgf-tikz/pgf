-- This package presents some examples of how different aspects of the
-- graph drawing engine can be used. In particular, the algorithms of
-- this package are not really meant to be used to layout graphs
-- (although they can be used, in principle); rather you are invited
-- to have a look at their implementation and to adapt them to your needs.
