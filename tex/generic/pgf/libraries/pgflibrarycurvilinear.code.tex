%
% This file defines commands for computing points in curvilinear
% coordinate systems.
%


%
% Curvilinear coordinate systems defined in terms of a Bezier curve.
%
% For the following coordinate systems, you must first provide a
% Bezier curve (using, as always, four points), which will be set for
% the current scope. When the curve is "installed" some expensive
% precomputations are done; subsequent calls to
% \pgfpointcurvilinearxxx based on this Bezier curve will be
% relatively quick.
%



% Install a Bezier curve
%
% #1 = start point
% #2 = first control point
% #3 = second control point
% #4 = end point
%
% Description:
%
% Subsequent calls to functions like
% \pgfpointcurvilinearbezierorthogonal will be relative to the curve
% installed using this command. The main job of this macro is a
% precomputation for computing length along the curve.
% All lengths along the Bezier curve are approximated using a lookup table
% of four time/length points. For this, an approximate time for length
% 1pt is computed first, and then the length for twice this time, four
% times this time, and eight times this time are approximated. A
% distance-to-time conversion is then done by a linear interpolation
% of distance-to-time for these four points. Note that all of these
% computations are not particularly precise, but a compromise trading
% speed against precision. Also note that the results will only be
% best near the start of the curve and may be far off near the end if
% that end is degenerate (second control point very near to end
% point).
%
% Example:
%
% \pgfsetcurvilinearbeziercurve
% {\pgfpoint{0mm}{10mm}}
% {\pgfpoint{5.5mm}{10mm}}
% {\pgfpoint{10mm}{5.5mm}}
% {\pgfpoint{10mm}{0mm}} % nearly a quarter circle
% \pgfpointcurvilinearbezierorthogonal{5mm}{5mm}
%   % should be 5mm along the circle, put at
%   % distance 15mm from the origin (5mm from the circle line).

% Compute a "Bezier-orthogonal" point for use in a nonlinear transformation.
%
% #1 = x
% #2 = y
%
% Description:
%
% In this coordinate system, the x-axis "goes along" the Bezier curve
% installed using \pgfsetcurvilinearbeziercurve
% and the y-axis is always perpendicular to the (Bezier) curve at the
% given x-coordinate. Formally, given a pair (x,y), let B(x) be the point on
% the Bezier curve B at distance x from the start of the curve. Let
% T(x) be the tangent of B at B(x) and let P(x) be the (normalized)
% vector perpendicular to T(x). Then (x,y) would be mapped to B(x) +
% y*P(x). As an example, if B is a circle, then the corresponding
% curvilinear coordinate system is (essentially, except for an offset in
% the y value) the polar coordinate system.
%
% In addition to setting \pgf@x and \pgf@y, \pgf@xa/ya will be set to
% a tangent along the curve at the given point and \pgf@xb/yb to a
% tangent orthogonal to the curve.

% Compute a "Bezier-polar" point.
%
% #1 = x

% Description:
%
% Let (r:d) be the point (x,y) in polar coordinates, that is, r is the
% angle and d the distance of (x,y) to the origin. The point returned
% by \pgfpointcurvilinearbezierpolar is now defined as follows: First,
% we compute that point at distance d along the Bezier curve B. Let
% B(d) be this point. Then, we rotate this point around the start of
% the curve (B(0)) by r degrees.
%
% As an example, consider a triangle with one tip at the origin and
% the other tips as (4cm,3cm) and (4cm,-3cm). Then this triangle would be
% transformed as follows: We take the first 5cm of the Bezier curve
% and rotate it by roughly 37 degrees to the left and by 37 degrees to
% the right.
%
% Note that this command is pretty expensive.
