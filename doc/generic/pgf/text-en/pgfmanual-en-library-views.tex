\section{Views Library}
\label{section-library-views}

\begin{tikzlibrary}{views}
    This library is used for creating \emph{views}, which are transformations
    of a part of a picture so that this part ``fits'' into a ``viewbox''.
    Mostly, views are useful in conjunction with animations.
\end{tikzlibrary}

A \emph{view} is essentially a ``window'' through which you see a graphic. To
establish a view, you specify a rectangle -- which is the window -- and another
rectangle surrounding the to-be-viewed graphic. The graphic will then be
rescaled and shifted in such a way that the to-be-viewed rectangle matches the
view's rectangle as well as possible. Note that establishing a view causes a
\emph{canvas} transformation to be installed, not a coordinate transformation.

View boxes are only seldom needed in normal graphics; you may prefer to use
coordinate transformations or the |spy| library. Their main application is with
animations since you can \emph{animate} the to-be-viewed rectangle. This makes
it easy to create animations in which you zoom in, zoom out, and pan a graphic.

\begin{key}{/tikz/meet=\meta{to-be-viewed corner}
        \opt{|rectangle|} \meta{to-be-viewed corner} \opt{|at|
        \meta{window corner} |rectangle| \meta{window corner}}%
}
    Use this key with a scope to establish a view for the scope. In the
    argument to the |meet| key, both |rectangle| texts are optional. Also,
    everything following |at| is optional; when it is missing, the \meta{window
    corner}s are assumed to be the same as the \meta{to-be-viewed corner}s. The
    latter are two corners of a rectangle that should be transformed in such a
    way that it fits inside the rectangle described by the two window corners.

    More precisely, at the beginning of the scope a canvas transformation is
    installed that scales and translates the canvas is such a way that
    %
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item the center of the to-be-viewed rectangle lies at the center of
            the window rectangle and
        \item the to-be-viewed rectangle has maximum size that it still fits
            inside the window rectangle.
    \end{enumerate}
    %
\begin{codeexample}[preamble={\usetikzlibrary{views}}]
\tikz {
  \draw [red, very thick] (0,0) rectangle (20mm,20mm);
  \begin{scope}[meet = {(0.5,0.5) (2.5,1.5) at (0,0) (2,2)}]
    \draw [blue, very thick] (5mm,5mm) rectangle (25mm,15mm);
    \draw [thick] (1,1) circle [x radius=5mm, y radius=10mm] node {Hi};
  \end{scope} }
\end{codeexample}
    %
\begin{codeexample}[preamble={\usetikzlibrary{views}}]
\tikz {
  \draw [red, very thick] (0,0) rectangle (20mm,20mm);
  \begin{scope}[slice = {(0.5,0.5) (2.5,1.5) at (0,0) (2,2)}]
    \draw [blue, very thick] (5mm,5mm) rectangle (25mm,15mm);
    \draw [thick] (1,1) circle [x radius=5mm, y radius=10mm] node {Hi};
  \end{scope} }
\end{codeexample}

    As mentioned earlier, the main use of views is in conjunction with
    animations. In order to animate a view, you specify the scope containing
    the |meet| command as the target object and then animate its |:view|
    attribute:
    %
\begin{codeexample}[preamble={\usetikzlibrary{animations,views}}]
\tikz [animate = {
  my scope:view = {
    begin on = { click, of next = here },
    0s = "{(0.5,0.5) (2.5,1.5)}",
    2s = "{(0.5,0) (1.5,2)}", forever
  }}] {
  \draw [red, fill=red!20, very thick, name=here]
    (0,0) rectangle (20mm,20mm);
  \begin{scope}[name = my scope,
                meet = {(0.5,0.5) (2.5,1.5) at (0,0) (2,2)}]
    \draw [blue, very thick] (5mm,5mm) rectangle (25mm,15mm);
    \draw [thick] (1,1) circle [x radius=5mm, y radius=10mm] node {Hi};
  \end{scope} }
\end{codeexample}
    %
    You can, of course, also specify the animation using the |animate myself:|
    key when you specify the animation inside the scope:
    %
\begin{codeexample}[preamble={\usetikzlibrary{animations,views}}]
\tikz [animate = {
  my scope:view = {
  }}] {
  \draw [red, fill=red!20, very thick, name=here]
    (0,0) rectangle (20mm,20mm);
  \begin{scope}[animate = { myself: = { :view = {
                  begin on = { click, of = here },
                  0s = "{(0.5,0.5) (2.5,1.5)}",
                  2s = "{(0.5,0) (1.5,2)}", forever }}},
                slice = {(0.5,0.5) (2.5,1.5) at (0,0) (2,2)}]
    \draw [blue, very thick] (5mm,5mm) rectangle (25mm,15mm);
    \draw [thick] (1,1) circle [x radius=5mm, y radius=10mm] node {Hi};
  \end{scope} }
\end{codeexample}
    %
\end{key}

\begin{key}{/tikz/view}
    This is an alias for |/tikz/meet|.
\end{key}

\begin{key}{/tikz/slice=\meta{to-be-viewed corner}
        \opt{|rectangle|} \meta{to-be-viewed corner} \opt{|at|
        \meta{window corner} |rectangle| \meta{window corner}}%
}
    This key works exactly like |meet|, only the second rule is changed:
    %
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[$2'$.] the to-be-viewed rectangle has minimal size that it
            encompasses all of the window rectangle.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{key}
