\section{Date and Calendar Utility Macros}
\label{section-calendar}

This section describes the package |pgfcalendar|.

\begin{package}{pgfcalendar}
    This package can be used independently of \pgfname. It has two purposes:
    %
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item It provides functions for working with dates. Most noticeably, it
            can convert a date in ISO-standard format (like 1975-12-26) to a
            so-called Julian day number, which is defined in Wikipedia as
            follows: ``The Julian day or Julian day number is the (integer)
            number of days that have elapsed since the initial epoch at noon
            Universal Time (UT) Monday, January 1, 4713 BC in the proleptic
            Julian calendar''. The package also provides a function for
            converting a Julian day number to an ISO-format date.

            Julian day numbers make it very easy to work with days. For
            example, the date ten days in the future of 2008-02-20 can be
            computed by converting this date to a Julian day number, adding 10,
            and then converting it back. Also, the day of week of a given date
            can be computed by taking the Julian day number modulo~7.
        \item It provides a macro for typesetting a calendar. This macro is
            highly configurable and flexible (for example, it can produce both
            plain text calendars and also complicated \tikzname-based
            calendars), but most users will not use the macro directly. It is
            the job of a frontend to provide useful configurations for
            typesetting calendars based on this command.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{package}


\subsection{Handling Dates}

\subsubsection{Conversions Between Date Types}

\begin{command}{\pgfcalendardatetojulian\marg{date}\marg{counter}}
    This macro converts a date in a format to be described in a moment to the
    Julian day number in the Gregorian calendar. The \meta{date} should expand
    to a string of the following form:
    %
    \begin{enumerate}
    \label{calendar-date-format}
        \item It should start with a number representing the year. Use |\year|
            for the current year, that is, the year the file is being typeset.
        \item The year must be followed by a hyphen.
        \item Next should come a number representing the month. Use |\month|
            for the current month. You can, but need not, use leading zeros.
            For example, |02| represents February, just like |2|.
        \item The month must also be followed by a hyphen.
        \item Next you must either provide a day of month (again, a number and,
            again, |\day| yields the current day of month) or the keyword
            |last|. This keyword refers to the last day of the month, which is
            automatically computed (and which is a bit tricky to compute,
            especially for February).
        \item Optionally, you can next provide a plus sign followed by positive
            or negative number. This number of days will be added to the
            computed date.
    \end{enumerate}

    Here are some examples:
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item |2006-01-01| refers to the first day of 2006.
        \item |2006-02-last| refers to February 28, 2006.
        \item |\year-\month-\day| refers to today.
        \item |2006-01-01+2| refers to January 3, 2006.
        \item |\year-\month-\day+1| refers to tomorrow.
        \item |\year-\month-\day+-1| refers to yesterday.
    \end{itemize}

    The conversion method is taken from the English Wikipedia entry on Julian
    days.

    \newcount\mycount
    \example |\pgfcalendardatetojulian{2007-01-14}{\mycount}| sets
    |\mycount| to
    \pgfcalendardatetojulian{2007-01-14}{\mycount}\the\mycount.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\pgfcalendarjuliantodate\marg{Julian day}\marg{year macro}\marg{month macro}\marg{day macro}}
    This command converts a Julian day number to an ISO-date. The \meta{Julian
    day} must be a number or \TeX\ counter, the \meta{year macro}, \meta{month
    macro} and \meta{day macro} must be \TeX\ macro names. They will be set to
    numbers representing the year, month, and day of the given Julian day in
    the Gregorian calendar.

    The \meta{year macro} will be assigned the year without leading zeros. Note
    that this macro will produce year 0 (as opposed to other calendars, where
    year 0 does not exist). However, if you really need calendars for before
    the year 1, it is expected that you know what you are doing anyway.

    The \meta{month macro} gets assigned a two-digit number representing the
    month (with a leading zero, if necessary). Thus, the macro is set to |01|
    for January.

    The \meta{day macro} gets assigned a two-digit number representing the day
    of the month (again, possibly with a leading zero).

    To convert a Julian day number to an ISO-date you use code like the
    following:
    %
\begin{verbatim}
\pgfcalendarjuliantodate{2454115}{\myyear}{\mymonth}{\myday}
\edef\isodate{\myyear-\mymonth-\myday}
\end{verbatim}
    %
    The above code sets |\isodate| to
    \pgfcalendarjuliantodate{2454115}{\myyear}{\mymonth}{\myday}%
    \edef\isodate{\myyear-\mymonth-\myday}\texttt{\isodate}.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\pgfcalendarjuliantoweekday\marg{Julian day}\marg{week day counter}}
    This command converts a Julian day to a week day by computing the day
    modulo 7. The \meta{week day counter} must be a \TeX\ counter. It will be
    set to 0 for a Monday, to 1 for a Tuesday, and so on.

    \example |\pgfcalendarjuliantoweekday{2454115}{\mycount}| sets
    |\mycount| to
    \pgfcalendarjuliantoweekday{2454115}{\mycount}\the\mycount\ (it was a Sunday).
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\pgfcalendareastersunday\marg{year}\marg{counter}}
    This command computes the date of Easter Sunday as a Julian date and stores
    it in \meta{counter}.

    \example |\pgfcalendareastersunday{2019}{\mycount}| sets
    |\mycount| to
    \pgfcalendareastersunday{2019}{\mycount}\the\mycount, which corresponds to
    \pgfcalendarjuliantodate{\mycount}{\myyear}{\mymonth}{\myday}%
    \edef\isodate{\myyear-\mymonth-\myday}\texttt{\isodate}.
\end{command}

\subsubsection{Checking Dates}

\begin{command}{\pgfcalendarifdate\marg{date}\marg{tests}\marg{code}\marg{else code}}
\label{pgfcalendarifdate}
    This command is used to execute code based on properties of \meta{date}.
    The \meta{date} must be a date in ISO-format. For this date, the
    \meta{tests} are checked (to be detailed later) and if one of the tests
    succeeds, the \meta{code} is executed. If none of the tests succeeds, the
    \meta{else code} is executed.

    \example |\pgfcalendarifdate{2007-02-07}{Wednesday}{Is a Wednesday}{Is not a Wednesday}|
    yields \texttt{\pgfcalendarifdate{2007-02-07}{Wednesday}{Is a Wednesday}{Is
    not a Wednesday}}.

    The \meta{tests} is a comma-separated list of key--value pairs. The
    following are defined by default:
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \itemcalendaroption{all} This test is passed by all dates.
        \itemcalendaroption{Monday} This test is passed by all dates that are
            Mondays.
        \itemcalendaroption{Tuesday} as above.
        \itemcalendaroption{Wednesday} as above.
        \itemcalendaroption{Thursday} as above.
        \itemcalendaroption{Friday} as above.
        \itemcalendaroption{Saturday} as above.
        \itemcalendaroption{Sunday} as above.
        \itemcalendaroption{workday} Passed by Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays,
            Thursdays, and Fridays. \itemcalendaroption{weekend} Passed by
            Saturdays and Sundays.
            \itemcalendaroption{equals}|=|\meta{reference} The \meta{reference}
            can be in one of two forms: Either, it is a full ISO format date
            like |2007-01-01| or the year may be missing as in |12-31|. In the
            first case, the test is passed if \meta{date} is the same as
            \meta{reference}. In the second case, the test is passed if the
            month and day part of \meta{date} is the same as \meta{reference}.

            For example, the test |equals=2007-01-10| will only be passed by
            this particular date. The test |equals=05-01| will be passed by
            every first of May on any year.
        \itemcalendaroption{at least}|=|\meta{reference} This test works
            similarly to the |equals| test, only it is checked whether
            \meta{date} is equal to \meta{reference} or to any later date.
            Again, the \meta{reference} can be a full date like |2007-01-01| or
            a short version like |07-01|. For example, |at least=07-01| is true
            for every day in the second half of any year.
        \itemcalendaroption{at most}|=|\meta{reference} as above.
        \itemcalendaroption{between}|=|\meta{start reference}| and |\meta{end
            reference} This test checks whether the current date lies between
            the two given reference dates. Both full and short version may be
            given.

            For example |between=2007-01-01 and 2007-02-28| is true for the
            days in January and February of 2007.

            For another example, |between=05-01 and 05-07| is true for the days
            of the first week of May of any year.
        \itemcalendaroption{day of month}|=|\meta{number} Passed by the day of
            month of the \meta{date} that is \meta{number}. For example, the
            test |day of month=1| is passed by every first of every month.
        \itemcalendaroption{end of month}\opt{|=|\meta{number}} Passed by the
            day of month of the \meta{date} that is \meta{number} from the end
            of the month. For example, the test |end of month=1| is passed by
            the last day of every month, the test |end of month=2| is passed by
            the second last day of every month. If \meta{number} is omitted, it
            is assumed to be |1|.
        \itemcalendaroption{Easter}\opt{|=|\meta{number}} This test checks
            whether the given date is Easter Sunday.  The optional number can
            be used for offsets from Easter Sunday, e.g.\ |Easter=-3| for
            Maundy Thursday, |Easter=-2| for Good Friday, |Easter=1| for Easter
            Monday.  Since the dates of other Christian holidays are determined
            by the date of Easter, these can be accessed as well, e.g.\
            |Easter=39| for Feast of the Ascension, |Easter=49| for Pentecost,
            and |Easter=50| for Whit Monday.
    \end{itemize}

    In addition to the above checks, you can also define new checks. To do so,
    you must add a new key to the path |/pgf/calendar/| using the |\pgfkeys|
    command. The job of the code of this new key is to possibly set the \TeX-if
    |\ifpgfcalendarmatches| to true (if it is already true, no action should be
    taken) to indicate that the \meta{date} passes the test setup by this new
    key.

    In order to perform the test, the key code needs to know the date that
    should be checked. The date is available through a macro, but a whole bunch
    of additional information about this date is also available through the
    following macros:
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item |\pgfcalendarifdatejulian| is the Julian day number of the
            \meta{date} to be checked.
        \item |\pgfcalendarifdateweekday| is the weekday of the \meta{date} to
            be checked.
        \item |\pgfcalendarifdateyear| is the year of the \meta{date} to be
            checked.
        \item |\pgfcalendarifdatemonth| is the month of the \meta{date} to be
            checked.
        \item |\pgfcalendarifdateday| is the day of month of the \meta{date} to
            be checked.
    \end{itemize}

    For example, let us define a new key that checks whether the \meta{date} is
    a Workers day (May 1st). This can be done as follows:
    %
\begin{verbatim}
\pgfkeys{/pgf/calendar/workers day/.code=%
{
  \ifnum\pgfcalendarifdatemonth=5\relax
    \ifnum\pgfcalendarifdateday=1\relax
      \pgfcalendarmatchestrue
    \fi
  \fi
}}
\end{verbatim}
    %
\end{command}


\subsubsection{Typesetting Dates}

\begin{command}{\pgfcalendarweekdayname\marg{week day number}}
    This command expands to a textual representation of the day of week, given
    by the \meta{week day number}. Thus, |\pgfcalendarweekdayname{0}| expands
    to |Monday| if the current language is English and to |Montag| if the
    current language is German, and so on. See
    Section~\ref{section-calendar-locale} for more details on translations.

    \example |\pgfcalendarweekdayname{2}| yields
    \texttt{\pgfcalendarweekdayname{2}}.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\pgfcalendarweekdayshortname\marg{week day number}}
    This command works similarly to the previous command, only an abbreviated
    version of the week day is produced.

    \example |\pgfcalendarweekdayshortname{2}| yields
    \texttt{\pgfcalendarweekdayshortname{2}}.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\pgfcalendarmonthname\marg{month number}}
    This command expands to a textual representation of the month, which is
    given by the \meta{month number}.

    \example |\pgfcalendarmonthname{12}| yields
    \texttt{\pgfcalendarmonthname{12}}.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\pgfcalendarmonthshortname\marg{month number}}
    As above, only an abbreviated version is produced.

    \example |\pgfcalendarmonthshortname{12}| yields
    \texttt{\pgfcalendarmonthshortname{12}}.
\end{command}


\subsubsection{Localization}
\label{section-calendar-locale}

All textual representations of week days or months (like ``Monday'' or
``February'') are wrapped with |\translate| commands from the |translator|
package (it this package is not loaded, no translation takes place).
Furthermore, the |pgfcalendar| package will try to load the
|translator-months-dictionary|, if the |translator| package is loaded.

The net effect of all this is that all dates will be translated to the current
language setup in the |translator| package. See the documentation of this
package for more details.


\subsection{Typesetting Calendars}

\begin{command}{\pgfcalendar\marg{prefix}\marg{start date}\marg{end date}\marg{rendering code}}
    This command can be used to typeset a calendar. It is a very general
    command, the actual work has to be done by giving clever implementations of
    \meta{rendering code}. Note that this macro need \emph{not} be called
    inside a |{pgfpicture}| environment (even though it typically will be) and
    you can use it to typeset calendars in normal \TeX\ or using packages other
    than \pgfname.


    \medskip
    \textbf{Basic typesetting process.}
    A calendar is typeset as follows: The \meta{start date} and \meta{end date}
    specify a range of dates. For each date in this range the \meta{rendering
    code} is executed with certain macros setup to yield information about the
    \emph{current date} (the current date in the enumeration of dates of the
    range). Typically, the \meta{rendering code} places nodes inside a picture,
    but it can do other things as well. Note that it is also the job of the
    \meta{rendering code} to position the calendar correctly.

    The different calls of the \meta{rending code} are not surrounded by \TeX\
    groups (though you can do so yourself, of course). This means that settings
    can accumulate between different calls, which is often desirable and
    useful.


    \medskip
    \textbf{Information about the current date.}
    Inside the \meta{rendering code}, different macros can be access:
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item |\pgfcalendarprefix| The \meta{prefix} parameter. This prefix is
            recommended for nodes inside the calendar, but you have to use it
            yourself explicitly.
        \item |\pgfcalendarbeginiso| The \meta{start date} of range being
            typeset in ISO format (like 2006-01-10).
        \item |\pgfcalendarbeginjulian| Julian day number of \meta{start date}.
        \item |\pgfcalendarendiso| The \meta{end date} of range being typeset
            in ISO format.
        \item |\pgfcalendarendjulian| Julian day number of \meta{end date}.
        \item |\pgfcalendarcurrentjulian| This \TeX\ count holds the Julian day
            number of the day currently being rendered.
        \item |\pgfcalendarcurrentweekday| The weekday (a number with zero
            representing Monday) of the current date.
        \item |\pgfcalendarcurrentyear| The year of the current date.
        \item |\pgfcalendarcurrentmonth| The month of the current date (always
            two digits with a leading zero, if necessary).
        \item |\pgfcalendarcurrentday| The day of month of the current date
            (always two digits).
    \end{itemize}


    \medskip
    {\bfseries The |\ifdate| command.}
    Inside the |\pgfcalendar| the macro |\ifdate| is available locally:
    %
    \begin{command}{\ifdate\marg{tests}\marg{code}\marg{else code}}
    \label{ifdate}%
        This command has the same effect as calling |\pgfcalendarifdate|
        for the current date.
    \end{command}


    \medskip
    \textbf{Examples.}
    In a first example, let us create a very simple calendar: It just lists the
    dates in a certain range.
    %
\begin{codeexample}[vbox,ignorespaces]
\pgfcalendar{cal}{2007-01-20}{2007-02-10}{\pgfcalendarcurrentday\ }
\end{codeexample}
    %
    Let us now make this a little more interesting: Let us add a line break
    after each Sunday.
    %
\begin{codeexample}[vbox,ignorespaces]
\pgfcalendar{cal}{2007-01-20}{2007-02-10}
{
  \pgfcalendarcurrentday\
  \ifdate{Sunday}{\par}{}
}
\end{codeexample}
    %
    We now want to have all Mondays to be aligned on a column. For this,
    different approaches work. Here is one based positioning each day
    horizontally using a skip.
    %
\begin{codeexample}[vbox,ignorespaces]
\pgfcalendar{cal}{2007-01-20}{2007-02-10}
{%
  \leavevmode%
  \hbox to0pt{\hskip\pgfcalendarcurrentweekday cm\pgfcalendarcurrentday\hss}%
  \ifdate{Sunday}{\par}{}%
}
\end{codeexample}
    %
    Let us now typeset two complete months.
    %
\begin{codeexample}[vbox,ignorespaces]
\pgfcalendar{cal}{2007-01-01}{2007-02-28}{%
  \ifdate{day of month=1}{
    \par\bigskip\hbox to7.5cm{\itshape\hss\pgfcalendarshorthand mt\hss}\par
  }{}%
  \leavevmode%
  {%
    \ifdate{weekend}{\color{black!50}}{\color{black}}%
    \hbox to0pt{%
      \hskip\pgfcalendarcurrentweekday cm%
      \hbox to1cm{\hss\pgfcalendarshorthand d-}\hss%
    }%
  }%
  \ifdate{Sunday}{\par}{}%
}
\end{codeexample}
    %
    For our final example, we use a |{tikzpicture}|.
    %
\begin{codeexample}[vbox,ignorespaces]
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \pgfcalendar{cal}{2007-01-20}{2007-02-10}{%
    \ifdate{workday}
      {\tikzset{filling/.style={fill=blue!20}}}
      {\tikzset{filling/.style={fill=red!20}}}
    \node (\pgfcalendarsuggestedname) at (\pgfcalendarcurrentweekday,0)
      [anchor=base,circle,filling] {\pgfcalendarcurrentday};
    \ifdate{Sunday}{\pgftransformyshift{-3em}}{}%
  }
  \draw (cal-2007-01-21) -- (cal-2007-02-03);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}
    %
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\pgfcalendarshorthand\marg{kind}\marg{representation}}
\label{pgfcalendarshorthand}
    This command can be used inside a |\pgfcalendar|, where it will expand to a
    representation of the current day, month, year or day of week, depending on
    whether \meta{kind} is |d|, |m|, |y| or |w|. The \meta{representation} can
    be one of the following: |-|, |=|, |0|, |.|, and |t|. They have the
    following meanings:
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The minus sign selects the shortest numerical representation
            possible (no leading zeros).
        \item The equal sign also selects the shortest numerical
            representation, but a space is added to single digit days and
            months (thereby ensuring that they have the same length as other
            days).
        \item The zero digit selects a two-digit numerical representation for
            days and months. For years it is allowed, but has no effect.
        \item The letter |t| selects a textual representation.
        \item The dot selects an abbreviated textual representation.
    \end{itemize}
    %
    Normally, you should say |\let\%=\pgfcalendarshorthand| locally, so that
    you can write |\%wt| instead of the much more cumbersome
    |\pgfcalendarshorthand{w}{t}|.
    %
\begin{codeexample}[leave comments]
\let\%=\pgfcalendarshorthand
\pgfcalendar{cal}{2007-01-20}{2007-01-20}
{ ISO form: \%y0-\%m0-\%d0, long form: \%wt, \%mt \%d-, \%y0}
\end{codeexample}
    %
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\pgfcalendarsuggestedname}
    This macro expands to a suggested name for nodes representing days in a
    calendar. If the \meta{prefix} is empty, it expands to the empty string,
    otherwise it expands to the \meta{prefix} of the calendar, followed by a
    hyphen, followed by the ISO format version of the date. Thus, when the date
    |2007-01-01| is typeset in a calendar for the prefix |mycal|, the macro
    expands to |mycal-2007-01-01|.
\end{command}
