\section{Declaring and Using Images}
\label{section-images}

This section describes the commands for creating images.


\subsection{Overview}

To be quite frank, \LaTeX's |\includegraphics| is designed better than
\pgfname's image mechanism. For this reason, \emph{I recommend that you use the
standard image inclusion mechanism of your format}. Thus, \LaTeX\ users are
encouraged to use |\includegraphics| to include images.

However, there are reasons why you might need to use the image inclusion
facilities of \pgfname:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item There is no standard image inclusion mechanism in your format. For
        example, plain \TeX\ does not have one, so \pgfname's inclusion
        mechanism is ``better than nothing''.

        However, this applies only to the |pdftex| backend. For all other
        backends, \pgfname\ currently maps its commands back to the |graphicx|
        package. Thus, in plain \TeX, this does not really help. It might be a
        good idea to fix this in the future such that \pgfname\ becomes
        independent of \LaTeX, thereby providing a uniform image abstraction
        for all formats.
    \item You wish to use masking. This is a feature that is only supported by
        \pgfname, though I hope that someone will implement this also for the
        graphics package in \LaTeX\ in the future.
\end{itemize}

Whatever your choice, you can still use the usual image inclusion facilities of
the |graphics| package.

The general approach taken by \pgfname\ to including an image is the following:
First, |\pgfdeclareimage| declares the image. This must be done prior to the
first use of the image. Once you have declared an image, you can insert it into
the text using |\pgfuseimage|. The advantage of this two-phase approach is
that, at least for \textsc{pdf}, the image data will only be included once in
the file. This can drastically reduce the file size if you use an image
repeatedly, for example in an overlay. However, there is also a command called
|\pgfimage| that declares and then immediately uses the image.

To speedup the compilation, you may wish to use the following class option:
%
\begin{packageoption}{draft}
    In draft mode boxes showing the image name replace the images. It is
    checked whether the image files exist, but they are not read. If either
    height or width is not given, 1cm is used instead.
\end{packageoption}


\subsection{Declaring an Image}

\begin{command}{\pgfdeclareimage\oarg{options}\marg{image name}\marg{filename}}
    Declares an image, but does not paint anything. To draw the image, use
    |\pgfuseimage{|\meta{image name}|}|. The \meta{filename} may not have an
    extension.  For \textsc{pdf}, the extensions |.pdf|, |.jpg|, and |.png|
    will automatically tried. For PostScript, the extensions |.eps|, |.epsi|,
    and |.ps| will be tried.

    The following options are possible:
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \declare{|height=|\meta{dimension}} sets the height of the image.
            If the width is not specified simultaneously, the aspect ratio of
            the image is kept.
        \item \declare{|width=|\meta{dimension}} sets the width of the image.
            If the height is not specified simultaneously, the aspect ratio of
            the image is kept.
        \item \declare{|page=|\meta{page number}} selects a given page number
            from a multipage document. Specifying this option will have the
            following effect: first, \pgfname\ tries to find a file named
            %
            \begin{quote}
                \meta{filename}|.page|\meta{page number}|.|\meta{extension}
            \end{quote}
            %
            If such a file is found, it will be used instead of the originally
            specified filename. If not, \pgfname\ inserts the image stored in
            \meta{filename}|.|\meta{extension} and if a recent version of
            |pdflatex| is used, only the selected page is inserted. For older
            versions of |pdflatex| and for |dvips| the complete document is
            inserted and a warning is printed.
        \item \declare{|interpolate=|\meta{true or false}} selects whether the
            image should be ``smoothed'' when zoomed. False by default.
        \item \declare{|mask=|\meta{mask name}} selects a transparency mask.
            The mask must previously be declared using |\pgfdeclaremask| (see
            below). This option only has an effect for |pdf|. Not all viewers
            support masking.
    \end{itemize}
    %
\begin{codeexample}[code only]
\pgfdeclareimage[interpolate=true,height=1cm]{image1}{brave-gnu-world-logo}
\pgfdeclareimage[interpolate=true,width=1cm,height=1cm]{image2}{brave-gnu-world-logo}
\pgfdeclareimage[interpolate=true,height=1cm]{image3}{brave-gnu-world-logo}
\end{codeexample}
    %
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\pgfaliasimage\marg{new image name}\marg{existing image name}}
    The \marg{existing image name} is ``cloned'' and the \marg{new image name}
    can now be used whenever the original image is used. This command is useful
    for creating aliases for alternate extensions and for accessing the last
    image inserted using |\pgfimage|.

    \example |\pgfaliasimage{image.!30!white}{image.!25!white}|
\end{command}


\subsection{Using an Image}

\begin{command}{\pgfuseimage\marg{image name}}
    Inserts a previously declared image into the \emph{normal text}. If you
    wish to use it in a |{pgfpicture}| environment, you must put a |\pgftext|
    around it.

    If the macro |\pgfalternateextension| expands to some nonempty
    \meta{alternate extension}, \pgfname\ will first try to use the image named
    \meta{image name}|.|\meta{alternate extension}. If this image is not
    defined, \pgfname\ will next check whether \meta{alternate extension}
    contains a |!| character. If so, everything up to this exclamation mark and
    including it is deleted from \meta{alternate extension} and the \pgfname\
    again tries to use the image \meta{image name}|.|\meta{alternate
    extension}. This is repeated until \meta{alternate extension} no longer
    contains a~|!|. Then the original image is used.

    The |xxcolor| package sets the alternate extension to the current color
    mixin.
    %
\begin{codeexample}[]
\pgfdeclareimage[interpolate=true,width=1cm,height=1cm]
  {image1}{brave-gnu-world-logo}
\pgfdeclareimage[interpolate=true,width=1cm]{image2}{brave-gnu-world-logo}
\pgfdeclareimage[interpolate=true,height=1cm]{image3}{brave-gnu-world-logo}
\begin{pgfpicture}
  \pgftext[at=\pgfpoint{1cm}{5cm},left,base]{\pgfuseimage{image1}}
  \pgftext[at=\pgfpoint{1cm}{3cm},left,base]{\pgfuseimage{image2}}
  \pgftext[at=\pgfpoint{1cm}{1cm},left,base]{\pgfuseimage{image3}}

  \pgfpathrectangle{\pgfpoint{1cm}{5cm}}{\pgfpoint{1cm}{1cm}}
  \pgfpathrectangle{\pgfpoint{1cm}{3cm}}{\pgfpoint{1cm}{1cm}}
  \pgfpathrectangle{\pgfpoint{1cm}{1cm}}{\pgfpoint{1cm}{1cm}}
  \pgfusepath{stroke}
\end{pgfpicture}
\end{codeexample}

    The following example demonstrates the effect of using |\pgfuseimage|
    inside a colormixin environment.
    %
\begin{codeexample}[preamble={\usepackage{xxcolor}}]
\pgfdeclareimage[interpolate=true,width=1cm,height=1cm]
  {image1.!25!white}{brave-gnu-world-logo.25}
\pgfdeclareimage[interpolate=true,width=1cm]
  {image2.25!white}{brave-gnu-world-logo.25}
\pgfdeclareimage[interpolate=true,height=1cm]
  {image3.white}{brave-gnu-world-logo.25}
\begin{colormixin}{25!white}
\begin{pgfpicture}
  \pgftext[at=\pgfpoint{1cm}{5cm},left,base]{\pgfuseimage{image1}}
  \pgftext[at=\pgfpoint{1cm}{3cm},left,base]{\pgfuseimage{image2}}
  \pgftext[at=\pgfpoint{1cm}{1cm},left,base]{\pgfuseimage{image3}}

  \pgfpathrectangle{\pgfpoint{1cm}{5cm}}{\pgfpoint{1cm}{1cm}}
  \pgfpathrectangle{\pgfpoint{1cm}{3cm}}{\pgfpoint{1cm}{1cm}}
  \pgfpathrectangle{\pgfpoint{1cm}{1cm}}{\pgfpoint{1cm}{1cm}}
  \pgfusepath{stroke}
\end{pgfpicture}
\end{colormixin}
\end{codeexample}
    %
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\pgfalternateextension}
    You should redefine this command to install a different alternate
    extension.

    \example |\def\pgfalternateextension{!25!white}|
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\pgfimage\oarg{options}\marg{filename}}
    Declares the image under the name |pgflastimage| and immediately uses it.
    You can ``save'' the image for later usage by invoking |\pgfaliasimage| on
    |pgflastimage|.
    %
\begin{codeexample}[preamble={\usepackage{xxcolor}}]
\begin{colormixin}{25!white}
\begin{pgfpicture}
  \pgftext[at=\pgfpoint{1cm}{5cm},left,base]
    {\pgfimage[interpolate=true,width=1cm,height=1cm]{brave-gnu-world-logo}}
  \pgftext[at=\pgfpoint{1cm}{3cm},left,base]
    {\pgfimage[interpolate=true,width=1cm]{brave-gnu-world-logo}}
  \pgftext[at=\pgfpoint{1cm}{1cm},left,base]
    {\pgfimage[interpolate=true,height=1cm]{brave-gnu-world-logo}}

  \pgfpathrectangle{\pgfpoint{1cm}{5cm}}{\pgfpoint{1cm}{1cm}}
  \pgfpathrectangle{\pgfpoint{1cm}{3cm}}{\pgfpoint{1cm}{1cm}}
  \pgfpathrectangle{\pgfpoint{1cm}{1cm}}{\pgfpoint{1cm}{1cm}}
  \pgfusepath{stroke}
\end{pgfpicture}
\end{colormixin}
\end{codeexample}
    %
\end{command}


\subsection{Masking an Image}

\begin{command}{\pgfdeclaremask\oarg{options}\marg{mask  name}\marg{filename}}
    Declares a transparency mask named \meta{mask name} (called a \emph{soft
    mask} in the \textsc{pdf} specification). This mask is read from the file
    \meta{filename}. This file should contain a grayscale image that is as
    large as the actual image. A white pixel in the mask will correspond to
    ``transparent'', a black pixel to ``solid'', and gray values correspond to
    intermediate values. The mask must have a single ``color channel''. This
    means that the mask must be a ``real'' grayscale image, not an
    \textsc{rgb}-image in which all \textsc{rgb}-triples happen to have the
    same components.

    You can only mask images the are in a ``pixel format''. These are |.jpg|
    and |.png|. You cannot mask |.pdf| images in this way. Also, again, the
    mask file and the image file must have the same size.

    The following options may be given:
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item |matte=|\marg{color components} sets the so-called \emph{matte}
            of the actual image (strangely, this has to be specified together
            with the mask, not with the image itself). The matte is the color
            that has been used to preblend the image. For example, if the image
            has been preblended with a red background, then \meta{color
            components} should be set to |{1 0 0}|. The default is |{1 1 1}|,
            which is white in the rgb model.

            The matte is specified in terms of the parent's image color space.
            Thus, if the parent is a grayscale image, the matte has to be set
            to |{1}|.
    \end{itemize}

    \example
    %
\begin{codeexample}[]
%% Draw a large colorful background
\pgfdeclarehorizontalshading{colorful}{5cm}{color(0cm)=(red);
color(2cm)=(green); color(4cm)=(blue); color(6cm)=(red);
color(8cm)=(green); color(10cm)=(blue); color(12cm)=(red);
color(14cm)=(green)}
\hbox{\pgfuseshading{colorful}\hskip-14cm\hskip1cm
\pgfimage[height=4cm]{brave-gnu-world-logo}\hskip1cm
\pgfimage[height=4cm]{brave-gnu-world-logo-mask}\hskip1cm
\pgfdeclaremask{mymask}{brave-gnu-world-logo-mask}
\pgfimage[mask=mymask,height=4cm,interpolate=true]{brave-gnu-world-logo}}
