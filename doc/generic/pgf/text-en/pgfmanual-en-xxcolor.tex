\section{Extended Color Support}

This section documents the package \texttt{xxcolor}, which is currently
distributed as part of \pgfname. This package extends the \texttt{xcolor}
package, written by Uwe Kern, which in turn extends the \texttt{color} package.
I hope that the commands in \texttt{xxcolor} will some day migrate to
\texttt{xcolor}, such that this package becomes superfluous.

The main aim of the \texttt{xxcolor} package is to provide an environment
inside which all colors are ``washed out'' or ``dimmed''. This is useful in
numerous situations and must typically be achieved in a roundabout manner if
such an environment is not available.

\begin{environment}{{colormixin}\marg{mix-in specification}}
    The mix-in specification is applied to all colors inside the environment.
    At the beginning of the environment, the mix-in is applied to the current
    color, i.\,e., the color that was in effect before the environment started.
    A mix-in specification is a number between 0 and 100 followed by an
    exclamation mark and a color name. When a |\color| command is encountered
    inside a mix-in environment, the number states what percentage of the
    desired color should be used. The rest is ``filled up'' with the color
    given in the mix-in specification. Thus, a mix-in specification like
    |90!blue| will mix in 10\% of blue into everything, whereas |25!white| will
    make everything nearly white.

\begin{codeexample}[width=4cm,preamble={\usepackage{xxcolor}}]
\begin{minipage}{3.5cm}\raggedright
\color{red}Red text,%
\begin{colormixin}{25!white}
  washed-out red text,
  \color{blue} washed-out blue text,
  \begin{colormixin}{25!black}
    dark washed-out blue text,
    \color{green} dark washed-out green text,%
  \end{colormixin}
  back to washed-out blue text,%
\end{colormixin}
and back to red.
\end{minipage}%
\end{codeexample}
    %
\end{environment}

Note that the environment only changes colors that have been installed using
the standard \LaTeX\ |\color| command. In particular, the colors in images are
not changed. There is, however, some support offered by the commands
|\pgfuseimage| and |\pgfuseshading|. If the first command is invoked inside a
|colormixin| environment with the parameter, say, |50!black| on an image with
the name |foo|, the command will first check whether there is also a defined
image with the name |foo.!50!black|. If so, this image is used instead. This
allows you to provide a different image for this case. If you nest |colormixin|
environments, the different mix-ins are all appended. For example, inside the
inner environment of the above example, |\pgfuseimage{foo}| would first check
whether there exists an image named |foo.!25!white!25!black|.

\begin{command}{\colorcurrentmixin}
    Expands to the current accumulated mix-in. Each nesting of a |colormixin|
    adds a mix-in to this list.

\begin{codeexample}[preamble={\usepackage{xxcolor}}]
\begin{minipage}{\linewidth-6pt}\raggedright
\begin{colormixin}{75!white}
  \colorcurrentmixin\ should be ``!75!white''\par
  \begin{colormixin}{75!black}
    \colorcurrentmixin\ should be ``!75!black!75!white''\par
    \begin{colormixin}{50!white}
      \colorcurrentmixin\ should be ``!50!white!75!black!75!white''\par
    \end{colormixin}
  \end{colormixin}
