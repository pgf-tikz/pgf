\section{Bounding Boxes for Bézier Curves}

\begin{pgflibrary}{bbox}
    This library provides methods to determine tight bounding boxes for
    Bézier curves. This library loads and uses the |fpu| library.
\end{pgflibrary}


\subsection{Bounding box without the library}

\tikzname{} determines the bounding box of (cubic) Bézier curves by
establishing the smallest rectangle that contains the end point and the two
control points of the curve.
%
\begin{codeexample}[width=5cm]
\begin{tikzpicture}[
    bullet/.style={circle,fill,inner sep=1pt},
]
    \draw (0,0) .. controls (-1,1) and (1,2) .. (2,0);
    \draw (current bounding box.south west)
        rectangle (current bounding box.north east);
    \draw[red,dashed]
        (0,0) -- (-1,1) node[bullet,label=above:{$(x_a,y_a)$}]{}
        (2,0) -- ( 1,2) node[bullet,label=above:{$(x_b,y_b)$}]{};
    \path
        (0,0) node[bullet,label=below:{$(x_0,y_0)$}]{}
        (2,0) node[bullet,label=below:{$(x_1,y_1)$}]{};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}

As one can see from this illustration, this may lead to drastic overestimates of
the bounding box.


\subsection{Computing the bounding box}

Establishing the precise bounding box has been discussed in various places, the
following discussion uses in part the results from
\url{https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/}. What is a cubic Bézier curve? A
cubic Bézier curve running from $(x_0,y_0)$ to $(x_1,y_1)$ with control points
$(x_a,y_a)$ and $(x_b,y_b)$ can be parameterized by
%
    \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:gammaBezier}
        \gamma(t) =
        \begin{pmatrix}
            x(t) \\ y(t)
        \end{pmatrix}
        =
        \begin{pmatrix}
            t^3 x_{1} + 3 t^2 (1-t) x_{b} + (1-t)^3 x_{0} + 3 t (1-t)^2 x_{a} \\
            t^3 y_{1} + 3 t^2 (1-t) y_{b} + (1-t)^3 y_{0} + 3 t (1-t)^2 y_{a}
        \end{pmatrix}
        \;,
    \end{equation}
%
where $t$ runs from 0 to 1 (and $\gamma(0) = (x_0,y_0)$ and $\gamma(1) =
(x_1,y_1)$). Surely, the bounding box has to contain $(x_0,y_0)$ and
$(x_1,y_1)$. If the functions $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ have extrema in the interval
$[0,1]$, then the bounding box will in general be larger than that. In order to
determine the extrema of the curve, all we need to find the extrema of the
functions $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ for $0 \le t \le 1$. That is, we need to find the
solutions of the quadratic equations
%
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}(t) = 0
            \quad\text{and}\quad
        \frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}t}(t) = 0  \;.
    \end{equation}
%
% (*parametrization of x:*)
% myx = x0 (1 - t)^3 + 3 xa (1 - t)^2 t + 3 xb (1 - t) t^2 +  x1 t^3
% (*d1\ne0 condition for t1 and t2 to exist*)
% === (*case d1\ne0*) ==
% d1 =  x0 - x1 - 3 xa + 3 xb
% (*square root, d2=0 \[Rule] only one solution,d2<0 \[Rule] no solution*)
% d2 =  x0*x1 - x1*xa + xa*xa - x0*xb - xa xb +  xb*xb
% (*first t*)
% t1 = (x0 - 2*xa + xb - sqrt(d2))/(x0 - x1 - 3*xa + 3*xb)
%    = (x0 - 2*xa + xb - sqrt(d2))/d1
% (*second t*)
% t2 = (x0 - 2*xa + xb + sqrt(d2))/(x0 - x1 - 3*xa + 3*xb)
%    = (x0 - 2*xa + xb + sqrt(d2))/d1
% === (*case d1=0*) ==
% (*2nd condition for extra condition: d3\ne0*)
% d3 = x1 + xa - 2 xb
% (*third t*)
% t3 = (x1 + 2*xa -  3*xb)/(2*d3)% d3 = x1 + 3 xa - 3 xb - x0
%
Let's discuss $x$ first. If the discriminant
%
    \begin{equation}
        d := x_0\,x_1 - x_1\,x_a + x_a\,x_a - x_0\,x_b - x_a x_b +  x_b\,x_b
    \end{equation}
%
is greater than 0, there are two solutions
%
    \begin{equation}
        t_\pm = \frac{x_{0} - 2x_{a} + x_{b}
            \pm \sqrt{d}}{x_{0} - x_{1} - 3(x_{a}- x_{b})}  \;.
    \end{equation}
%
If the denominator $x_{0} - x_{1} - 3(x_{a} - x_{b})$ vanishes, one may use the
l'Hospital rule to determine the solutions. In this case, we need to make sure
that the bounding box contains, say $(x(t_-),y_0)$ and $(x(t_+),y_0)$. If $d
\le 0$, the bounding box does not need to be increased in the $x$ direction. On
the other hand, if there are solutions, one needs include the points
$\bigl(x(t_\pm),y_0\bigr)$ with $x(t)$ from equation~\eqref{eq:gammaBezier} in
the bounding box.

The analogous statements apply to $y(t)$.


\subsection{Using the library}

\begin{key}{/pgf/bezier bounding box=\meta{boolean} (default true)}
    Turn the tight bounding box algorithm on and off. The initial value is
    |false|.

    \emph{Caveat:} As can be seen from the derivations, the necessary
    computations involve the squaring of lengths and taking ratios of lengths,
    which can easily lead to |Dimension too large| errors. The library uses
    |fpu| to account for that, but errors may still occur.
\end{key}

\begin{codeexample}[width=5cm,preamble={\usetikzlibrary{bbox}}]
\begin{tikzpicture}[
    bezier bounding box,
    bullet/.style={circle,fill,inner sep=1pt},
]
    \draw (0,0) .. controls (-1,1) and (1,2) .. (2,0);
    \draw (current bounding box.south west)
        rectangle (current bounding box.north east);
    \draw[red,dashed]
        (0,0) -- (-1,1) node[bullet,label=above:{$(x_a,y_a)$}]{}
        (2,0) -- ( 1,2) node[bullet,label=above:{$(x_b,y_b)$}]{};
    \path
        (0,0) node[bullet,label=below:{$(x_0,y_0)$}]{}
        (2,0) node[bullet,label=below:{$(x_1,y_1)$}]{};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}

A few comments are in order.
%
\begin{enumerate}
    \item For paths with arrow heads one may need to load the |bending|
        library. This is because otherwise the quick arrow head distorts the
        path, and this happens after the bounding box has been computed. Even
        worse, arrow heads could get deformed.
    \item If you shorten a path by some negative length, the bounding box will
        not be accurate either. However, this has nothing to do with curves, it
        also applies to straight lines. So this is not specific to the |bbox|
        library but something that one may want to keep in mind.
    \item Let us also note that the computations can lead to
        |Dimension too large| errors. These errors do not come directly from
        the computations done by the library, which uses |fpu| for its
        computations, but from the aftermath. Many of these problems can be
        avoided by using the |fpu| library also for computing reciprocals as in
        e.g.
        %
\begin{codeexample}[preamble={\usetikzlibrary{bbox}}]
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \pgfmathsetmacro{\rnda}{360*rnd}
    \pgfmathsetmacro{\rndb}{360*rnd}
    \pgfmathsetmacro{\rndc}{360*rnd}
    \pgfmathsetmacro{\rndd}{3*rnd}
    \pgfmathsetmacro{\rnde}{3*rnd}
    \pgfmathsetmacro{\rndf}{3*rnd}
  \begin{scope}[/pgf/fpu/install only={reciprocal},bezier bounding box=true]
    \draw (0,0) .. controls (\rnda:\rndd) and (\rndb:\rnde) .. (\rndc:\rndf);
  \end{scope}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}
        %
        Please note that this is done in a local scope. This is because
        currently there is no reverse operation to uninstall these definitions
        at the moment.
\end{enumerate}
