\section{Constructing Paths}

\subsection{Overview}

The ``basic entity of drawing'' in \pgfname\ is the \emph{path}. A path
consists of several parts, each of which is either a closed or open curve. An
open curve has a starting point and an end point and, in between, consists of
several \emph{segments}, each of which is either a straight line or a Bézier
curve. Here is an example of a path (in red) consisting of two parts, one open,
one closed:
%
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2]
  \draw[thick,red]
       (0,0) coordinate (a)
    -- coordinate (ab) (1,.5) coordinate (b)
    .. coordinate (bc) controls +(up:1cm) and +(left:1cm) .. (3,1)  coordinate (c)
       (0,1) -- (2,1) -- coordinate (x) (1,2) -- cycle;

  \draw (a)  node[below] {start part 1}
        (ab) node[below right] {straight segment}
        (b)  node[right] {end first segment}
        (c)  node[right] {end part 1}
        (x)  node[above right]  {part 2 (closed)};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}

A path, by itself, has no ``effect'', that is, it does not leave any marks on
the page. It is just a set of points on the plane. However, you can \emph{use}
a path in different ways. The most natural actions are \emph{stroking} (also
known as \emph{drawing}) and \emph{filling}. Stroking can be imagined as
picking up a pen of a certain diameter and ``moving it along the path''.
Filling means that everything ``inside'' the path is filled with a uniform
color. Naturally, the open parts of a path must first be closed before a path
can be filled.

In \pgfname, there are numerous commands for constructing paths, all of which
start with |\pgfpath|. There are also commands for \emph{using} paths, though
most operations can be performed by calling |\pgfusepath| with an appropriate
parameter.

As a side-effect, the path construction commands keep track of two bounding
boxes. One is the bounding box for the current path, the other is a bounding
box for all paths in the current picture. See Section~\ref{section-bb} for more
details.

Each path construction command extends the current path in some way. The
``current path'' is a global entity that persists across \TeX\ groups. Thus,
between calls to the path construction commands you can perform arbitrary
computations and even open and close \TeX\ groups. The current path only gets
``flushed'' when the |\pgfusepath| command is called (or when the soft-path
subsystem is used directly, see Section~\ref{section-soft-paths}).


\subsection{The Move-To Path Operation}

The most basic operation is the move-to operation. It must be given at the
beginning of paths, though some path construction command (like
|\pgfpathrectangle|) generate move-tos implicitly. A move-to operation can also
be used to start a new part of a path.

\begin{command}{\pgfpathmoveto\marg{coordinate}}
    This command expects a \pgfname-coordinate like |\pgfpointorigin| as its
    parameter. When the current path is empty, this operation will start the
    path at the given \meta{coordinate}. If a path has already been partly
    constructed, this command will end the current part of the path and start a
    new one.
    %
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{pgfpicture}
  \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfpointorigin}
  \pgfpathlineto{\pgfpoint{1cm}{1cm}}
  \pgfpathlineto{\pgfpoint{2cm}{1cm}}
  \pgfpathlineto{\pgfpoint{3cm}{0.5cm}}
  \pgfpathlineto{\pgfpoint{3cm}{0cm}}
  \pgfsetfillcolor{yellow!80!black}
  \pgfusepath{fill,stroke}
\end{pgfpicture}
\end{codeexample}
    %
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{pgfpicture}
  \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfpointorigin}
  \pgfpathlineto{\pgfpoint{1cm}{1cm}}
  \pgfpathlineto{\pgfpoint{2cm}{1cm}}
  \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfpoint{2cm}{1cm}} % New part
  \pgfpathlineto{\pgfpoint{3cm}{0.5cm}}
  \pgfpathlineto{\pgfpoint{3cm}{0cm}}
  \pgfsetfillcolor{yellow!80!black}
  \pgfusepath{fill,stroke}
\end{pgfpicture}
\end{codeexample}
    %
    The command will apply the current coordinate transformation matrix to
    \meta{coordinate} before using it.

    It will update the bounding box of the current path and picture, if
    necessary.
\end{command}


\subsection{The Line-To Path Operation}

\begin{command}{\pgfpathlineto\marg{coordinate}}
    This command extends the current path in a straight line to the given
    \meta{coordinate}. If this command is given at the beginning of path
    without any other path construction command given before (in particular
    without a move-to operation), the \TeX\ file may compile without an error
    message, but a viewer application may display an error message when trying
    to render the picture.
    %
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{pgfpicture}
  \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfpointorigin}
  \pgfpathlineto{\pgfpoint{1cm}{1cm}}
  \pgfpathlineto{\pgfpoint{2cm}{1cm}}
  \pgfsetfillcolor{yellow!80!black}
  \pgfusepath{fill,stroke}
\end{pgfpicture}
\end{codeexample}
    %
    The command will apply the current coordinate transformation matrix to
    \meta{coordinate} before using it.

    It will update the bounding box of the current path and picture, if
    necessary.
\end{command}


\subsection{The Curve-To Path Operations}

\begin{command}{\pgfpathcurveto\marg{support 1}\marg{support 2}\marg{coordinate}}
    This command extends the current path with a Bézier curve from the last
    point of the path to \meta{coordinate}. The \meta{support 1} and
    \meta{support 2} are the first and second support point of the Bézier
    curve. For more information on Bézier curves, please consult a standard
    textbook on computer graphics.

    Like the line-to command, this command may not be the first path
    construction command in a path.
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{pgfpicture}
  \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfpointorigin}
  \pgfpathcurveto
    {\pgfpoint{1cm}{1cm}}{\pgfpoint{2cm}{1cm}}{\pgfpoint{3cm}{0cm}}
  \pgfsetfillcolor{yellow!80!black}
  \pgfusepath{fill,stroke}
\end{pgfpicture}
\end{codeexample}
    %
    The command will apply the current coordinate transformation matrix to
    \meta{coordinate} before using it.

    It will update the bounding box of the current path and picture, if
    necessary. However, the bounding box is simply made large enough such that
    it encompasses all of the support points and the \meta{coordinate}. This
    will guarantee that the curve is completely inside the bounding box, but
    the bounding box will typically be quite a bit too large. It is not clear
    (to me) how this can be avoided without resorting to ``some serious math''
    in order to calculate a precise bounding box.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\pgfpathquadraticcurveto\marg{support}\marg{coordinate}}
    This command works like |\pgfpathcurveto|, only it uses a quadratic Bézier
    curve rather than a cubic one. This means that only one support point is
    needed.
    %
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{pgfpicture}
  \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfpointorigin}
  \pgfpathquadraticcurveto
    {\pgfpoint{1cm}{1cm}}{\pgfpoint{2cm}{0cm}}
  \pgfsetfillcolor{yellow!80!black}
  \pgfusepath{fill,stroke}
\end{pgfpicture}
\end{codeexample}
    %
    Internally, the quadratic curve is converted into a cubic curve. The only
    noticeable effect of this is that the points used for computing the
    bounding box are the control points of the converted curve rather than
    \meta{support}. The main effect of this is that the bounding box will be a
    bit tighter than might be expected. In particular, \meta{support} will not
    always be part of the bounding box.
\end{command}

There exist two commands to draw only part of a cubic Bézier curve:

\begin{command}{\pgfpathcurvebetweentime\marg{time $t_1$}\marg{time $t_2$}\marg{point p}\marg{point $s_1$}\marg{point $s_2$}\marg{point q}}
    This command draws the part of the curve described by $p$, $s_1$, $s_2$ and
    $q$ between the times $t_1$ and $t_2$. A time value of 0 indicates the
    point $p$ and a time value of 1 indicates point $q$. This command includes
    a moveto operation to the first point.
    %
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw [thin] (0,0) .. controls (0,2) and (3,0) .. (3,2);
  \pgfpathcurvebetweentime{0.25}{0.9}{\pgfpointxy{0}{0}}{\pgfpointxy{0}{2}}
    {\pgfpointxy{3}{0}}{\pgfpointxy{3}{2}}
  \pgfsetstrokecolor{red}
  \pgfsetstrokeopacity{0.5}
  \pgfsetlinewidth{2pt}
  \pgfusepath{stroke}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}
    %
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\pgfpathcurvebetweentimecontinue\marg{time $t_1$}\marg{time $t_2$}\marg{point p}\marg{point $s_1$}\marg{point $s_2$}\marg{point q}}
    This command works like |\pgfpathcurvebetweentime|, except that a moveto
    operation is \emph{not} made to the first point.
\end{command}


\subsection{The Close Path Operation}

\begin{command}{\pgfpathclose}
    This command closes the current part of the path by appending a straight
    line to the start point of the current part. Note that there \emph{is} a
    difference between closing a path and using the line-to operation to add a
    straight line to the start of the current path. The difference is
    demonstrated by the upper corners of the triangles in the following
    example:
    %
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,2);
  \pgfsetlinewidth{5pt}
  \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfpoint{1cm}{1cm}}
  \pgfpathlineto{\pgfpoint{0cm}{-1cm}}
  \pgfpathlineto{\pgfpoint{1cm}{-1cm}}
  \pgfpathclose
  \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfpoint{2.5cm}{1cm}}
  \pgfpathlineto{\pgfpoint{1.5cm}{-1cm}}
  \pgfpathlineto{\pgfpoint{2.5cm}{-1cm}}
  \pgfpathlineto{\pgfpoint{2.5cm}{1cm}}
  \pgfusepath{stroke}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}
    %
\end{command}


\subsection{Arc, Ellipse and Circle Path Operations}

The path construction commands that we have discussed up to now are sufficient
to create all paths that can be created ``at all''. However, it is useful to
have special commands to create certain shapes, like circles, that arise often
in practice.

In the following, the commands for adding (parts of) (transformed) circles to a
path are described.

\begin{command}{\pgfpatharc\marg{start angle}\marg{end angle}{\ttfamily\char`\{}\meta{radius}\opt{| and |\meta{y-radius}}{\ttfamily\char`\}}}
    This command appends a part of a circle (or an ellipse) to the current
    path. Imagine the curve between \meta{start angle} and \meta{end angle} on
    a circle of radius \meta{radius} (if $\meta{start angle} < \meta{end
    angle}$, the curve goes around the circle counterclockwise, otherwise
    clockwise). This curve is now moved such that the point where the curve
    starts is the previous last point of the path. Note that this command will
    \emph{not} start a new part of the path, which is important for example for
    filling purposes.
    %
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,2);
  \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfpointorigin}
  \pgfpathlineto{\pgfpoint{0cm}{1cm}}
  \pgfpatharc{180}{90}{.5cm}
  \pgfpathlineto{\pgfpoint{3cm}{1.5cm}}
  \pgfpatharc{90}{-45}{.5cm}
  \pgfusepath{fill}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}

    Saying |\pgfpatharc{0}{360}{1cm}| ``nearly'' gives you a full circle. The
    ``nearly'' refers to the fact that the circle will not be closed. You can
    close it using |\pgfpathclose|.

    If the optional \meta{y-radius} is given, the \meta{radius} is the
    $x$-radius and the \meta{y-radius} the $y$-radius of the ellipse from which
    the curve is taken:
    %
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,2);
  \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfpointorigin}
  \pgfpatharc{180}{45}{2cm and 1cm}
  \pgfusepath{draw}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}

    The axes of the circle or ellipse from which the arc is ``taken'' always
    point up and right. However, the current coordinate transformation matrix
    will have an effect on the arc. This can be used to, say, rotate an arc:
    %
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,2);
  \pgftransformrotate{30}
  \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfpointorigin}
  \pgfpatharc{180}{45}{2cm and 1cm}
  \pgfusepath{draw}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}

    The command will update the bounding box of the current path and picture,
    if necessary. Unless rotation or shearing transformations are applied, the
    bounding box will be tight.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\pgfpatharcaxes\marg{start angle}\marg{end angle}\marg{first axis}\marg{second axis}}
    This command is similar to |\pgfpatharc|. The main difference is how the
    ellipse or circle is specified from which the arc is taken. The two
    parameters \meta{first axis} and \meta{second axis} are the $0^\circ$-axis
    and the $90^\circ$-axis of the ellipse from which the path is taken. Thus,
    |\pgfpatharc{0}{90}{1cm and 2cm}| has the same effect as
    %
\begin{verbatim}
\pgfpatharcaxes{0}{90}{\pgfpoint{1cm}{0cm}}{\pgfpoint{0cm}{2cm}}
\end{verbatim}
    %
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,2);
  \draw (0,0) -- (2cm,5mm) (0,0) -- (0cm,1cm);

  \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfpoint{2cm}{5mm}}
  \pgfpatharcaxes{0}{90}{\pgfpoint{2cm}{5mm}}{\pgfpoint{0cm}{1cm}}
  \pgfusepath{draw}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}
    %
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\pgfpatharcto\marg{x-radius}\marg{y-radius}\marg{rotation} \marg{large arc flag}\marg{counterclockwise flag}\\\marg{target point}}
    This command (which directly corresponds to the arc-path command of
    \textsc{svg}) is used to add an arc to the path that starts at the current
    point and ends at \meta{target point}. This arc is part of an ellipse that
    is determined in the following way: Imagine an ellipse with radii
    \meta{x-radius} and \meta{y-radius} that is rotated around its center by
    \meta{rotation} degrees. When you move this ellipse around in the plane,
    there will be exactly two positions such that the two current point and the
    target point lie on the border of the ellipse (excluding pathological
    cases). The flags \meta{large arc flag} and \meta{clockwise flag} are then
    used to decide which of these ellipses should be picked and which arc on
    the picked ellipsis should be used.
    %
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,2);

  \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfpoint{0mm}{20mm}}
  \pgfpatharcto{3cm}{1cm}{0}{0}{0}{\pgfpoint{3cm}{1cm}}
  \pgfusepath{draw}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}
    %
    Both flags are considered to be false exactly if they evaluate to |0|,
    otherwise they are true. If the \meta{large arc flag} is true, then the
    angle spanned by the arc will be greater than $180^\circ$, otherwise it
    will be less than $180^\circ$. The \meta{clockwise flag} is used to
    determine which of the two ellipses should be used: if the flag is true,
    then the arc goes from the current point to the target point in a
    counterclockwise direction, otherwise in a clockwise fashion.
    %
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \pgfsetlinewidth{2pt}
  % Flags 0 0: red
  \pgfsetstrokecolor{red}
  \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfpointorigin}
  \pgfpatharcto{20pt}{10pt}{0}{0}{0}{\pgfpoint{20pt}{10pt}}
  \pgfusepath{stroke}
  % Flags 0 1: blue
  \pgfsetstrokecolor{blue}
  \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfpointorigin}
  \pgfpatharcto{20pt}{10pt}{0}{0}{1}{\pgfpoint{20pt}{10pt}}
  \pgfusepath{stroke}
  % Flags 1 0: orange
  \pgfsetstrokecolor{orange}
  \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfpointorigin}
  \pgfpatharcto{20pt}{10pt}{0}{1}{0}{\pgfpoint{20pt}{10pt}}
  \pgfusepath{stroke}
  % Flags 1 1: black
  \pgfsetstrokecolor{black}
  \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfpointorigin}
  \pgfpatharcto{20pt}{10pt}{0}{1}{1}{\pgfpoint{20pt}{10pt}}
  \pgfusepath{stroke}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}
    %
    \emph{Warning:} The internal computations necessary for this command are
    numerically very unstable. In particular, the arc will not always really
    end at the \meta{target coordinate}, but may be off by up to several
    points. A more precise positioning is currently infeasible due to \TeX's
    numerical weaknesses. The only case it works quite nicely is when the
    resulting angle is a multiple of~$90^\circ$.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\pgfpatharctoprecomputed\marg{center point}\marg{start angle}\marg{end angle}\marg{end point}\\\marg{x-radius}\marg{y-radius}\marg{ratio x-radius/y-radius}\marg{ratio y-radius/x-radius}}
    A specialized arc operation which is fast and numerically stable, provided
    a lot of information is given in advance.

    In contrast to |\pgfpatharc|, it explicitly interpolates start and end
    points.

    In contrast to |\pgfpatharcto|, this routine is numerically stable and
    quite fast since it relies on a lot of available information.
    %
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,2);

  \def\cx{1.5cm}% center x
  \def\cy{1cm}% center y
  \def\startangle{0}%
  \def\endangle{270}%
  \def\a{1.5cm}% xradius
  \def\b{0.5cm}% yradius
  \pgfmathparse{\a/\b}\let\abratio=\pgfmathresult
  \pgfmathparse{\b/\a}\let\baratio=\pgfmathresult
  %
  % start point:
  \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfpoint{\cx+\a*cos(\startangle)}{\cy+\b*sin(\startangle)}}%
  \pgfpatharctoprecomputed
    {\pgfpoint{\cx}{\cy}}
    {\startangle}
    {\endangle}
    {\pgfpoint{\cx+\a*cos(\endangle)}{\cy+\b*sin(\endangle)}}% end point
    {\a}
    {\b}
    {\abratio}
    {\baratio}
  \pgfusepath{draw}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}

    \begin{command}{\pgfpatharctomaxstepsize}
        The quality of arc approximation taken by |\pgfpatharctoprecomputed| by
        means of Bézier splines is controlled by a mesh width, which is
        initially

        |\def\pgfpatharctoprecomputed{45}|.

        The mesh width is provided in (full!) degrees. The smaller the mesh
        width, the more precise the arc approximation.

        Use an empty value to disable spline approximation (uses a single cubic
        polynomial for the complete arc).

        The value must be an integer!
    \end{command}
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\pgfpathellipse\marg{center}\marg{first axis}\marg{second axis}}
    The effect of this command is to append an ellipse to the current path (if
    the path is not empty, a new part is started). The ellipse's center will be
    \meta{center} and \meta{first axis} and \meta{second axis} are the axis
    \emph{vectors}. The same effect as this command can also be achieved using
    an appropriate sequence of move-to, arc, and close operations, but this
    command is easier and faster.
    %
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,2);
  \pgfpathellipse{\pgfpoint{1cm}{0cm}}
                 {\pgfpoint{1.5cm}{0cm}}
                 {\pgfpoint{0cm}{1cm}}
  \pgfusepath{draw}
  \color{red}
  \pgfpathellipse{\pgfpoint{1cm}{0cm}}
                 {\pgfpoint{1cm}{1cm}}
                 {\pgfpoint{-0.5cm}{0.5cm}}
  \pgfusepath{draw}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}

    The command will apply coordinate transformations to all coordinates of the
    ellipse. However, the coordinate transformations are applied only after the
    ellipse is ``finished conceptually''. Thus, a transformation of 1cm to the
    right will simply shift the ellipse one centimeter to the right; it will
    not add 1cm to the $x$-coordinates of the two axis vectors.

    The command will update the bounding box of the current path and picture,
    if necessary.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\pgfpathcircle\marg{center}\marg{radius}}
    A shorthand for |\pgfpathellipse| applied to \meta{center} and the two axis
    vectors $(\meta{radius},0)$ and $(0,\meta{radius})$.
\end{command}


\subsection{Rectangle Path Operations}

Another shape that arises frequently is the rectangle. Two commands can be used
to add a rectangle to the current path. Both commands will start a new part of
the path.

\begin{command}{\pgfpathrectangle\marg{corner}\marg{diagonal vector}}
    Adds a rectangle to the path whose one corner is \meta{corner} and whose
    opposite corner is given by $\meta{corner} + \meta{diagonal vector}$.
    %
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,2);
  \pgfpathrectangle{\pgfpoint{1cm}{0cm}}{\pgfpoint{1.5cm}{1cm}}
  \pgfpathrectangle{\pgfpoint{1.5cm}{0.25cm}}{\pgfpoint{1.5cm}{1cm}}
  \pgfpathrectangle{\pgfpoint{2cm}{0.5cm}}{\pgfpoint{1.5cm}{1cm}}
  \pgfusepath{draw}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}
    %
    The command will apply coordinate transformations and update the bounding
    boxes tightly.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\pgfpathrectanglecorners\marg{corner}\marg{opposite corner}}
    Adds a rectangle to the path whose two opposing corners are \meta{corner}
    and \meta{opposite corner}.
    %
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,2);
  \pgfpathrectanglecorners{\pgfpoint{1cm}{0cm}}{\pgfpoint{1.5cm}{1cm}}
  \pgfusepath{draw}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}
    %
    The command will apply coordinate transformations and update the bounding
    boxes tightly.
\end{command}


\subsection{The Grid Path Operation}

\begin{command}{\pgfpathgrid\oarg{options}\marg{first corner}\marg{second corner}}
    Appends a grid to the current path. That is, a (possibly large) number of
    parts are added to the path, each part consisting of a single horizontal or
    vertical straight line segment.

    Conceptually, the origin is part of the grid and the grid is clipped to the
    rectangle specified by the \meta{first corner} and the \meta{second
    corner}. However, no clipping occurs (this command just adds parts to the
    current path) and the points where the lines enter and leave the ``clipping
    area'' are computed and used to add simple lines to the current path.

    The following keys influence the grid:
    %
    \begin{key}{/pgf/stepx=\meta{dimension} (initially 1cm)}
        The horizontal stepping.
    \end{key}
    %
    \begin{key}{/pgf/stepy=\meta{dimension} (initially 1cm)}
        The vertical stepping.
    \end{key}
    %
    \begin{key}{/pgf/step=\meta{vector}}
        Sets the horizontal stepping to the $x$-coordinate of \meta{vector} and
        the vertical stepping to its $y$-coordinate.
    \end{key}
    %
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{pgfpicture}
  \pgfsetlinewidth{0.8pt}
  \pgfpathgrid[step={\pgfpoint{1cm}{1cm}}]
    {\pgfpoint{-3mm}{-3mm}}{\pgfpoint{33mm}{23mm}}
  \pgfusepath{stroke}
  \pgfsetlinewidth{0.4pt}
  \pgfpathgrid[stepx=1mm,stepy=1mm]
    {\pgfpoint{-1.5mm}{-1.5mm}}{\pgfpoint{31.5mm}{21.5mm}}
  \pgfusepath{stroke}
\end{pgfpicture}
\end{codeexample}
    %
    The command will apply coordinate transformations and update the bounding
    boxes. As for ellipses, the transformations are applied to the
    ``conceptually finished'' grid.
    %
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{pgfpicture}
  \pgftransformrotate{10}
  \pgfpathgrid[stepx=1mm,stepy=2mm]{\pgfpoint{0mm}{0mm}}{\pgfpoint{30mm}{30mm}}
  \pgfusepath{stroke}
\end{pgfpicture}
\end{codeexample}
    %

\subsection{The Parabola Path Operation}

\begin{command}{\pgfpathparabola\marg{bend vector}\marg{end vector}}
    This command appends two half-parabolas to the current path. The first
    starts at the current point and ends at the current point plus \meta{bend
    vector}. At this point, it has its bend. The second half parabola starts at
    that bend point and ends at point that is given by the bend plus \meta{end
    vector}.

    If you set \meta{end vector} to the null vector, you append only a half
    parabola that goes from the current point to the bend; by setting
    \meta{bend vector} to the null vector, you append only a half parabola that
    goes through the current point and \meta{end vector} and has its bend at
    the current point.

    It is not possible to use this command to draw a part of a parabola that
    does not contain the bend.
    %
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{pgfpicture}
  % Half-parabola going ``up and right''
  \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfpointorigin}
  \pgfpathparabola{\pgfpointorigin}{\pgfpoint{2cm}{4cm}}
  \color{red}
  \pgfusepath{stroke}

  % Half-parabola going ``down and right''
  \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfpointorigin}
  \pgfpathparabola{\pgfpoint{-2cm}{4cm}}{\pgfpointorigin}
  \color{blue}
  \pgfusepath{stroke}

  % Full parabola
  \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfpoint{-2cm}{2cm}}
  \pgfpathparabola{\pgfpoint{1cm}{-1cm}}{\pgfpoint{2cm}{4cm}}
  \color{orange}
  \pgfusepath{stroke}
\end{pgfpicture}
\end{codeexample}
    %
    The command will apply coordinate transformations and update the bounding
    boxes.
\end{command}


\subsection{Sine and Cosine Path Operations}

Sine and cosine curves often need to be drawn and the following commands may
help with this. However, they only allow you to append sine and cosine curves
in intervals that are multiples of $\pi/2$.

\begin{command}{\pgfpathsine\marg{vector}}
    This command appends a sine curve in the interval $[0,\pi/2]$ to the
    current path. The sine curve is squeezed or stretched such that the curve
    starts at the current point and ends at the current point plus
    \meta{vector}.
    %
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,1);
  \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfpoint{1cm}{0cm}}
  \pgfpathsine{\pgfpoint{1cm}{1cm}}
  \pgfusepath{stroke}

  \color{red}
  \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfpoint{1cm}{0cm}}
  \pgfpathsine{\pgfpoint{-2cm}{-2cm}}
  \pgfusepath{stroke}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}
    %
    The command will apply coordinate transformations and update the bounding
    boxes.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\pgfpathcosine\marg{vector}}
    This command appends a cosine curve in the interval $[0,\pi/2]$ to the
    current path. The curve is squeezed or stretched such that the curve starts
    at the current point and ends at the current point plus \meta{vector}.
    Using several sine and cosine operations in sequence allows you to produce
    a complete sine or cosine curve
    %
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{pgfpicture}
  \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfpoint{0cm}{0cm}}
  \pgfpathsine{\pgfpoint{1cm}{1cm}}
  \pgfpathcosine{\pgfpoint{1cm}{-1cm}}
  \pgfpathsine{\pgfpoint{1cm}{-1cm}}
  \pgfpathcosine{\pgfpoint{1cm}{1cm}}
  \pgfsetfillcolor{yellow!80!black}
  \pgfusepath{fill,stroke}
\end{pgfpicture}
\end{codeexample}
    %
    The command will apply coordinate transformations and update the bounding
    boxes.
\end{command}


\subsection{Plot Path Operations}

There exist several commands for appending plots to a path. These commands are
available through the module |plot|. They are documented in
Section~\ref{section-plots}.


\subsection{Rounded Corners}

Normally, when you connect two straight line segments or when you connect two
curves that end and start ``at different angles'', you get ``sharp corners''
between the lines or curves. In some cases it is desirable to produce ``rounded
corners'' instead. Thus, the lines or curves should be shortened a bit and then
connected by arcs.

\pgfname\ offers an easy way to achieve this effect, by calling the following
two commands.

\begin{command}{\pgfsetcornersarced\marg{point}}
    This command causes all subsequent corners to be replaced by little
    arcs. The effect of this command lasts till the end of the current
    \TeX\ scope.

    The \meta{point} dictates how large the corner arc will be. Consider a
    corner made by two lines $l$ and~$r$ and assume that the line $l$ comes
    first on the path. The $x$-dimension of the \meta{point} decides by how
    much the line~$l$ will be shortened, the $y$-dimension of \meta{point}
    decides by how much the line $r$ will be shortened. Then, the shortened
    lines are connected by an arc.
    %
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,2);

  \pgfsetcornersarced{\pgfpoint{5mm}{5mm}}
  \pgfpathrectanglecorners{\pgfpointorigin}{\pgfpoint{3cm}{2cm}}
  \pgfusepath{stroke}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}

\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,2);

  \pgfsetcornersarced{\pgfpoint{10mm}{5mm}}
  % 10mm entering,
  % 5mm leaving.
  \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfpointorigin}
  \pgfpathlineto{\pgfpoint{0cm}{2cm}}
  \pgfpathlineto{\pgfpoint{3cm}{2cm}}
  \pgfpathcurveto
    {\pgfpoint{3cm}{0cm}}
    {\pgfpoint{2cm}{0cm}}
    {\pgfpoint{1cm}{0cm}}
  \pgfusepath{stroke}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}

    If the $x$- and $y$-coordinates of \meta{point} are the same and the corner
    is a right angle, you will get a perfect quarter circle (well, not quite
    perfect, but perfect up to six decimals). When the angle is not $90^\circ$,
    you only get a fair approximation.

    More or less ``all'' corners will be rounded, even the corner generated by
    a |\pgfpathclose| command. (The author is a bit proud of this feature.)
    %
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{pgfpicture}
  \pgfsetcornersarced{\pgfpoint{4pt}{4pt}}
  \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfpointpolar{0}{1cm}}
  \pgfpathlineto{\pgfpointpolar{72}{1cm}}
  \pgfpathlineto{\pgfpointpolar{144}{1cm}}
  \pgfpathlineto{\pgfpointpolar{216}{1cm}}
  \pgfpathlineto{\pgfpointpolar{288}{1cm}}
  \pgfpathclose
  \pgfusepath{stroke}
\end{pgfpicture}
\end{codeexample}

    To return to normal (unrounded) corners, use
    |\pgfsetcornersarced{\pgfpointorigin}|.

    Note that the rounding will produce strange and undesirable effects if the
    lines at the corners are too short. In this case the shortening may cause
    the lines to ``suddenly extend over the other end'' which is rarely
    desirable.
\end{command}


\subsection{Internal Tracking of Bounding Boxes for Paths and Pictures}
\label{section-bb}

\makeatletter

The path construction commands keep track of two bounding boxes: One for the
current path, which is reset whenever the path is used and thereby flushed, and
a bounding box for the current |{pgfpicture}|.

\begin{command}{\pgfresetboundingbox}
    Resets the picture's bounding box. The picture will simply forget any
    previous bounding box updates and start collecting from scratch.

    You can use this together with |\pgfusepath{use as bounding box}| to
    replace the bounding box by the one of a particular path (ignoring
    subsequent paths).
\end{command}

The bounding boxes are not accessible by ``normal'' macros. Rather, two sets of
four dimension variables are used for this, all of which contain the
letter~|@|.

\begin{textoken}{\pgf@pathminx}
    The minimum $x$-coordinate ``mentioned'' in the current path. Initially,
    this is set to $16000$pt.
\end{textoken}

\begin{textoken}{\pgf@pathmaxx}
    The maximum $x$-coordinate ``mentioned'' in the current path. Initially,
    this is set to $-16000$pt.
\end{textoken}

\begin{textoken}{\pgf@pathminy}
    The minimum $y$-coordinate ``mentioned'' in the current path. Initially,
    this is set to $16000$pt.
\end{textoken}

\begin{textoken}{\pgf@pathmaxy}
    The maximum $y$-coordinate ``mentioned'' in the current path. Initially,
    this is set to $-16000$pt.
\end{textoken}

\begin{textoken}{\pgf@picminx}
    The minimum $x$-coordinate ``mentioned'' in the current picture. Initially,
    this is set to $16000$pt.
\end{textoken}

\begin{textoken}{\pgf@picmaxx}
    The maximum $x$-coordinate ``mentioned'' in the current picture. Initially,
    this is set to $-16000$pt.
\end{textoken}

\begin{textoken}{\pgf@picminy}
    The minimum $y$-coordinate ``mentioned'' in the current picture. Initially,
    this is set to $16000$pt.
\end{textoken}

\begin{textoken}{\pgf@picmaxy}
    The maximum $y$-coordinate ``mentioned'' in the current picture. Initially,
    this is set to $-16000$pt.
\end{textoken}


Each time a path construction command is called, the above variables are
(globally) updated. To facilitate this, you can use the following command:

\begin{command}{\pgf@protocolsizes\marg{x-dimension}\marg{y-dimension}}
    Updates all of the above dimensions in such a way that the point specified
    by the two arguments is inside both bounding boxes. For the picture's
    bounding box this updating occurs only if |\ifpgf@relevantforpicturesize|
    is true, see below.
\end{command}

For the bounding box of the picture it is not always desirable that every path
construction command affects this bounding box. For example, if you have just
used a clip command, you do not want anything outside the clipping area to
affect the bounding box. For this reason, there exists a special ``\TeX\ if''
that (locally) decides whether updating should be applied to the picture's
bounding box. Clipping will set this if to false, as will certain other
commands.

\begin{command}{\pgf@relevantforpicturesizefalse}
    Suppresses updating of the picture's bounding box.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\pgf@relevantforpicturesizetrue}
    Causes updating of the picture's bounding box.
\end{command}
