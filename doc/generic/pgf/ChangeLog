2016-03-31 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Lots of bugfixes in animation and svg code.
    - Added optimizations to reduce file size for svg code
      (better support by dvisvgm will be needed however for more
      compact text!).

2016-03-18 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - activated math parser in foreach's end notation to allow \foreach \i in {0,...,10-9}

2015-09-09 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Worked on pgfsys-dvisvgm.def a lot. Now requires
    dvisvgm-1.5.3 because of switch from pt to bp there. Does
    correct bounding box computations.

2015-09-06 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>

    - fixed bug in luamath library

2015-08-29 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>

2015-08-13 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - First work on animations for svg. Added commands in pgfsys
    and added module pgfmoduleanimations. No documnetation yet.

2015-08-07 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Release 3.0.1!

2015-08-03 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>

    - fixed regression introduced for pgf 3.0.0 (bug #149): leading empty
    lines at the beginning of plot files disabled '-- plot'
    - fixed bug #291 (missing white space trimming in node labels)
    - fixed bug #313 (alias option did not respect name prefix/suffix)
    - fixed bug #341 ("is in pic" was not reset)
    - fixed bug #365 (caused by missing adoption after copy-paste in tikzlibraryfolding)
    - fixed bug #315/316 by applying the suggested patch and verifying it

2015-06-12 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>

    - fixed fpu math functions for int, ceil, and floor
    - added \pgfmathlogtwo and \pgfmathlogten as requested in bug #359


2015-06-06 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed problem in gd: Creating more than about 15 vertices
    inside a graph drawing algorithm was impossible since this
    created too many text input levels. Reorganized the interplay
    between tex and lua for the coroutine so that no input levels
    are created.

2015-06-05 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added number nodes option to graph lib.

2015-05-18 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed nullfont warnings in axes in datavisualization.
    - Fixed wrong axes for school book plots.

2015-05-15 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed nullfont warnings when parsing logic gate inputs.

2015-05-08 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed bug in tikz.code.tex concerning colors for arrow tips:
    Setting and restoring the global color "trackers"
    pgf@fillcolor@global over groups was done only in \pgfscope,
    but not in the scopes opened and closed by tikz when drawing a
    path (\pgfsys@beginscope is used there). This caused wrong
    colors to be used.

2015-05-08 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Updated patterns.meta library.

2015-05-02 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>

    - context: committed patch to adopt pgfutil-context for new (incompatible)
    context handling of colors -- contains some cleanup by Hans Hagen.

2015-03-28 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>

    - fixed bug in external lib: braces in external filenames confused the generator

2015-01-02 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>

    - fixed bug in fpu: equal(x, 0) failed for x<0

2014-12-30 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>

    - fixed bug in atan2 (returned wrong sign for atan2(4e-5,-5))
    - implemented atan2 in FPU

2014-11-02 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>

    - fixed save stack issue (TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [save size=250000])
    if the color changes a _huge_ number of times during a single path.

2014-10-11 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>

    - worked on LUA math parser: ensured that a suitable first scope of
    functions works. I also added support for 'declare function'

2014-10-11 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added provisional code for patterns.meta library. Patterns
        can now be declared using TikZ code with additional support
        for tile transformations. Currently only PDF output supported
    at back-end (uses \pgfsys@declarepattern@meta in pgfsys-pdftex.def).

2014-08-04 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>

    - finished first prototype of a LUA math parser. It is orders of magnitude
    faster than its TeX pendant, features a pure LUA mode and also offers a
    fallback to the TeX \pgfmathparse for unsupported operations/functions
    only defined in TeX.

2014-07-09 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>

    - fixed bug (regression of bug #229): external lib with dvips produced
    wrong bounding box (was broken entirely)

2014-07-08 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>

    - fixed regression in external lib: 'mode=graphics if exists' broke any
    undefined label warnigns
    - added automatic "fast lane" to math parser: if the input is a number
    without units, it will return that as-is. Reduces typesetting time down to
    66% for huge scatter plots and has just 1% overhead for math intensive
    figures.

2014-06-22 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>

    - added switch 'trig format=deg|rad' which allows to switch sin,cos,tan,
    and their friends to radians. It works for all user input
    arguments - I hope without unanticipated side-effects (marked as
    experimental)

2014-05-17 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>

    - external lib: defined suitable defaults for 'system call' depending on driver
    - external lib: solved incompatibility with biblatex's \cite[][]{name}
    command    (http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/173465/tikz-error-for-externalized-graphics-but-output-is-correct}
    - number parser/printer: added switch 'read comma as period' to read
    localized input numbers. Off by default but added useful hint to parser
    message.

2014-05-06 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed bug #308 fixedpointarithmetic: unwanted spaces by line ends 

2014-03-30 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed feature #81: signum function (fpu + pgf basic layer)

2014-03-24 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed all \begin{scope} and \end{scope} in foldings lib,
    changed them to \scope and \endscope.

2014-03-21 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed #303 Type in pgfmanual (colormixin)
    - Fixed #302 pgf-3.0: Cannot plot a constant function. Will
    now center the constant line.
    - Addressed #299 Precision problem with explicitily anchored
    labels: While not a bug, I added a "centered" option for cases
    similar to this one (although, in this particular case, the
    new centered option is not what is needed)...
    - Fixed #298 \pgfarrowsdeclare is still mentioned in pgfmanual
    - Fixed #294 Nodes for arcs, which angles are calculated
    simultaneously.
    - Fixed #292 "node scale and outer sep" by introducing the new
    option "outer sep=auto", which takes care of both this problem
    (at least in all normal cases) and also of the draw versus
    fill problem with outer seps.

2014-03-20 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed #285 \tikz@intersect@namedpaths persists outside
    scopes as suggested.
    - Fixed #284 Additional rerun statement for overlays (for LyX)
    by adding the proposed solution (essentially).
    - Added post-fix for #288 by undoing all -- ligatures in
    verbatim code.

2014-03-19 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fxied #283 "Is there a smarter way to handle units in math
    engine?" by adding the "scalar" function.
    - Fixed #288 "All the '£' should be '$' in the examples of
    pgfmanual..." by switching to T1 enconding.
    - Fixed #282 "\pgfmathredeclarefunction does not work properly."

2014-02-24 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added first edge routing algorithm to gd.
    
2014-02-02 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - intersections libs: improved robustness and accuracy for curveto paths
    by using the floating point library together with Mark Wibrow. 

2014-01-08 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>

    - fixed bug in latex/plain tex shipout routines for xdvipdfmx and xelatex:
    combination of shadings    and standalone package failed to work.

2013-12-31 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fix for 'rotate around x/y/z' keys which now evaluate
      the argument provided.
      
2013-12-25 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>

    - intersections lib: detected duplicates in line-to intersections
    in endpoints and suppressed them.
    - intersections lib: stored time offset for each intersections as optional
    property (i.e. if it comes for free). This is required to compute fill
    paths

2013-12-20 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Release 3.0.0!    

2013-12-20 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - In preparation for the release 3.0.0, I pimped the manual a
      bit. It will now automatically detect whether graph drawing
      C libs are available or not. Also, syntax hilighting is now
      always switched on. I also some subtle optical hints to
      crossreferenced words in the code examples; this is pretty
      useful, I think. 
    - Did a lot of cleaning up for the release.
    
2013-12-18 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed a bug in Vertex.lua that returned wrong anchor
      positions for non-centered vertices.
    
2013-12-13 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed bug #280 "Layered layout" produces unknown key with graphs library.
    - Fixed bug #279 "Some parts of arguments in foreach macro are lost".
    - Fixed bug #258 "Default arrow edge style puts circumflex in
      drawn end node" by now allowing people to say tip=on proper draw.
    
2013-12-08 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>

    - intersections lib: ensured that 'name path global' is reset between main paths.

2013-11-30 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>

    - worked on intersections lib (internals only); added O(N) list
    append/prepend utilities

2013-11-18 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added keys 'rotate around x', 'rotate around y' and
    'rotate around z' to rotate the xyz coordinate system
    around the x, y, or z axis.
    
2013-11-17 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixes for 'text effects along path' decoration and docs.

2013-11-16 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>

    - external lib: added support for 'up to date check=md5' for lualatex.
      Now, lualatex and pdftex both result in the same checksums (by means of
      \usepackage{pdftexcmds})

2013-11-16 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Finalised 'text effects along path' decoration and docs.
      
2013-11-11 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Changed keyval example (and references to define@key) 
      in pgfcalendar documentation to pgfkeys stuff.

2013-11-08 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Minor fixes to decorations.text and math libraries documentation
    
2013-11-07 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added 'text effects along path' decoration. 

2013-11-01 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed regression/bug in 'name path global'.

2013-10-31 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - Applied path for bug #277 "\beforeforegroundpath not working".
    
2013-10-09 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Prepared manual for new release (fixed overful boxes and
      index problems).
    
2013-10-08 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Updated math library (minor fixes).

2013-10-07 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - Applied some fixes so that C code for graph drawing works
      once more.
    - Arrow tips and their doc are now officially finished!
    - Added documentation of nonlinear transformations. 
    
2013-10-06 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>

    - modified release script to allow uploads of unstable TDS
      zips to http://pgf.sourceforge.net using
      make -f pgf/scripts/pgf/Makefile.pgf_release upload USER=cfeuersaenger

2013-10-02 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed problem with math parser inserting extraneous
      spaces when parsing \dimenexpr
      
2013-09-30 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Changed blend mode syntax to standard pgf syntax (since PDF
      and SVG do not agree on names...).
    - Added scale and slant options for arrow tips.
    - Added more generic arrow tips.
    
2013-09-24 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - First version of comlete arrow documentation finished. Still
      need to document the arrows.meta library, though.
    - Added "tips" option for drawing arrow tips without drawing
      paths.
    
2013-09-23 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - Fixed bug #273 "Graph drawing sublayouts fails".
    - Incorporated first partial documentation of the arrow tips
      into the main documentation.
    - Fixed bug bugs:#272 "SVG parser error after close path" as
      suggested by Mark Wibrow.
    - Also changed the default syntax for svg path command so that
      it uses braces instead of quotation marks. (Quotation marks
      still work, of course.)

2013-09-22 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Started working on arrow doc.
    
2013-09-20 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added macro to convert string of digits to comma separated list.
    
2013-09-18 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - First version of new arrow tip management done. Up and
      running! Still needs documentation and the old arrow tip
      codes should (but need not) be ported.
    - Did some porting of old code, added fixes. Doc still missing.
    
2013-09-17 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed bug #264: "\pgfkeys /errors/unknown key should (?) expand first argument"
    - Fixed bug #268: "`matrix of nodes' isn't working properly any more"
    
2013-09-11 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Corrected typos (bug #266 and bug #265)

2013-09-11 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - added magnetic tape shape.

2013-09-09 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed bug #262/267: "Line breaks are not working in labels anyy more."
    - Fixed bug #260: "TikZ node on background in pgfextra"
    - Started work on bending arrows.
    
2013-09-05 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>

    - external lib: fixed bug: file dependency handling was incorrect and
    suffered from regression caused by MD5 checks

2013-08-31 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>

    - repaired incompatibility with pgfplots <= 1.8: samples key was
    evaluated in context of floating point unit and new pgf code relied on dimension
    registers.

2013-08-29 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added "turn" key.
    
2013-08-28 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added "angle" pic type and "angles" library.
    - Patched gd loader code so that it works with context mark IV.
    
2013-08-27 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added new pic path command.
    - Patched pgfsys-dvipdfmx.def to step around the bug in
    (x)dvipdfmx that caused scaled boxes (including scaled
    graphics) inside nodes to be displayed incorrectly.
    
2013-08-24 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - fixed bug in fpu: 0^0 and 0^x both produced nan. Now we get
      0^0=1 and 0^x = 0.

2013-08-22 Till Tantau <tantua@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Removed claims from manual (not by me...) that TikZ does not
      work with Mark IV of context. I just tried it and everything
      I tried (including advanced stuff like shadings) worked fine.
    
2013-08-18 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed pgf intersection library to ensure that
      specialround tokens are processed.

2013-08-06 Till Tantau <tantua@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added support for dvisvgm. Quite nice...
    
2013-08-05 Till Tantau <tantua@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Worked on tex4ht code. Works reasonably well know and even
      graph drawing is possible (when luatex is used for
      typesetting; for this I needed to fix some latin1 characters in
      html4.4ht). Also, I renamed /tikz/tex4ht... to /pgf/tex4ht
      (someone else added that) since tikz has nothing to do with
      that stuff. 
      Typesetting the manual in tex4ht no longer works, but that seems
      like too much bother for my taste. 

2013-08-02 Till Tantau <tantua@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed bug #256 "The special \pgfcoordinate macro doesn't
    expand \pgfpictureid." 

2013-08-04 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - external lib: fixed incompatibility of pdflscape with
    external lib

2013-08-01 Till Tantau <tantua@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed a problem with pdf resources of transparency groups in
    dvipdfmx. 
    
2013-07-31 Till Tantau <tantua@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed bug #149 "/tikz/raw gnuplot ignoring segmented plot"
      by introducing a new way of handling plot streams. There are
      now new kinds of points (outliers and undefined points) and
      "new data sets" commands inside streams. Handlers (like the
      lineto and curve handlers) can be configured to interpret
      these as jumps (this is the default).  
    - Fixed bug #255 "Trig computations offend fp via fixedpointarithmetic lib"
    
2013-07-31 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>
    - Added "math" library. Could be integrated with calc library.
    
2013-07-26 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed bug in external lib: mode=list and make did not cope well with
    \ref in externalized images. These will be remade now.

2013-07-24 Till Tantau <tantua@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed bug #162 "PGF manual examples use undefined "shape example" style"
    - Fixed bug #169 "ghostscript error: /undefined in pgfo"
    - Concerning bug #167 "node pin option sets
      inconsistent/incorrect angle" I added some clarification in
      the manual that explains the observed behaviour.
    - Fixed bug #158 "\pgfmathparse does not support e-TeXs
      \numexpr and \dimexpr". You can now also use
      \pgfmathsetlength to assign a muskip a value. Internally,
      "mu" is treated like "pt", but if an expression contains
      "mu", \pgfmathsetlength and \pgfmathaddtolength will convert
      the number to "mu" before the assignment.
    
2013-07-22 Till Tantau <tantua@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed bug #173 "Tikz's transparency, xelatex and preview
      package" by adding a specific fix for the interaction
      between preview.sty and everyshi.sty in pgfutil-latex.def.

2013-07-19 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - optimized mark=* and mark=o (q path versions lead to 10% time reduction)
    - adopted new pgfkeys feature to /handler config/full or existing (
      required when /.search also is used to find the correct key path)

2013-07-19 Till Tantau <tantua@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed bug #175 "In PGF oo module, calling a method strips grouping"
    - Fixed bug #181 "Need to document |- coordinates using calc notation"
    - Fixed bug #187 "\pgfmathanglebetweenpoints is not documented"
    - Increased accuracy of atan, atan2 and
      \pgfmathanglebetweenpoints.     

2013-07-18 Till Tantau <tantua@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed bug "#168 PGF is sensitive to dollar catcode"
    - Fixed bug "#186 pgfonlayer makes pgf forget options" and
      added "every on background layer" option.
    - Fixed bug "#192 pgffor scope iteration is buggy"
    - Fixed bug "#196 Incoherent syntax for Bézier curves"
    - Fixed bug "#199 Drawing error for chamfered rectangle"
    - Fixed bug "#201 Markings fail with "Dimension too Large" on
      certain paths" by fixing a mistake and the decoration core
      and, additionally, in pgfmathanglebetweenpoints.
    - Fixed bug "#254 building currenct CVS version fails on
      graphdrawing with current luatex": Will now work nicely with
      TeXLive 2013 and Lua 5.2.
    - Added feature request "bug #203 Blending modes and better transparency"
    
2013-07-17 Till Tantau <tantua@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - Fixed bug #204 "strange influence of \baselinestretch on
      tikz figure" by no longer sharing \pgfutil@tempa with latex:
      This register gets changed by LaTeX in a fontchange, which, in
      turn can happen at the beginning of every
      \pgfmathsetlength. 
    - Fixed bug #207 "Decoration markings not on path on large
      lines" by using a more precise computation of positions on
      straight lines in decorations. Also, the angle computation
      is now much more precise by fixedin bug #201.
    - Fixed bug #212 "Error if using plot into a \foreach loop in
      a single path" by making \pgffor@beginhook and friends local
      to the current \foreach. A nice side-effect is that one can
      now nest \foreach statements on a path and also mix in the
      plots. Hopefully, no one relied on the (undocumented,
      unsupported) old bevahiour of the hooks.
    - Fixed bug #213 "pgfmathsetcounter only works in local scope"
      by adding a note in the documentation.
    - Fixed bug #211 "\nodepart ignores text transparency"
    - Fixed bug #220 "Transformations ignored in edge decoration."
    - Fixed bug #221 "xyz spherical and cylindrical coordinate, radius not defined"
    - Fixed bug #225 "pgfkeys "/errors/unknown choice value" ignores parameters"
    - Fixed bug #253 "\pgfkeysfiltered cannot accept long arguments"
    - Fixed bug #252 "I'm not able to build the current CVS
    version". This included a number of patches to fix problems
    introduced with the bugfixes introduced recently
    
2013-07-16 Till Tantau <tantua@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - Fixed bug #226 "matrix column sep=-\pgflinewidth changes after empty cell"
    - Fixed bug #229 "pgfpagesuselayout breaks beamer class"
      (hopefully, setting page sizes is really messy in TeX!).
    - Fixed bug #232 "pow function broken for 0^x for non-integer values of x"
    - Fixed bug #165 "\draw with empty domain results in infinite calculation"
    - Added better error message to adress bug #244 "mindmap-style
    "invalidates" coordinate shape."
    - Fixed bug #235 "\def\costhirty{0.8660256} not really used"
    
2013-07-15 Till Tantau <tantua@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - Fixed bug "#237 CVS-version: pdfimage error: key interpolate undefined"
    - Fixed bug "#245 broken key /pgf/decoration/reset marks"
    - Fixed bug "#239 picture disappear after a zero-width rectangle width shading"
    - Fixed bug "#247 Error messages hard to catch in plain TeX/ConTeXt"
    - Fixed bug "#166 Possibly typos in circuits.logic.IEC"
    - Fixed bug "#249 pgfkeys: /handlers/first char syntax is not
    'self-contained' (CVS version)" 
    - Fixed bug "#248 circuits adjustable annotation improperly placed"
    
2013-07-13 Till Tantau <tantua@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - Fixed bug "#250 pgfkyes: .append style and similar undouble # tokens"
    - Fixed bug "#143 label changes center of a matrix node"

2013-07-12 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - Fixed bug #128 "fit does not scale if used in scaled scope"
    - Fixed bug #136 "\hrulefill inherits or not pgf line styles"
    - Fixed bug #224 "Including Tikzpicture in third part of
      multipart node" 

2013-07-11 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - Fixed bug #251 "cross out shape interacts with path options of path it is drawn on"
    - Fixed bug #139 "Placement of node inside matix environment"
    - Fixed bug #131 "text centering calculates wrong" and added
      new "node font" option.
    - Fixed bug #121 "Annoying "Underfull \hbox (badness 10000)" message"
    - Fixed bug #134 "Edge node style affecting arrowhead".
    
2013-07-08 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - Fixed bug #132 "Error in matrix with column sep "between"
    origins"    
    - Fixed bug #133 "\draw[-<<,>=stealth] (10,45) -- (40,45); does
    not work." However, this introduces a (small, only visual)
    incompatibility with previous versions. If you need the visual
    effect "-<<" used to have (which, in a sense, was wrong), use
    "-< <" instead. The new "-> >" is also quite handy.
    
2013-06-28 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed bug #116 "Decorations can't be repositioned when
      pre/post used."
    
2013-06-25 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - Fixed bug #241 "div/null error by (270:length) and a fading line."
    - Fixed bug #126 "Incorrect placed labels for inplicite positioned nodes."
    - Added foreach syntax to nodes. This is useful and also
      needed to fix the problem that the foreach statement cannot
      be used after a to path.
    
2013-06-24 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - Fixed bug #18 and #74 (active characters and tikz) by virtue
      of the new "babel" library, which deactivates catcodes at the
      beginning of tikz pictures and reactivates them in nodes.
    
2013-06-21 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed bug #110 "cannot add node after cycle operation"
    - Fixed bug #88 "\pgftransformarrow does not rotate with \pgfpointanchor"
    - Fixed bug #86 "macro-expanded tree node has bad edge anchor"
    - Fixed bug #85 "PGF + Crop package, at least for pdftex."
    
2013-06-20 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - Fixed bug #83 "Transparency Problem with \usepackage{endfloat}."
    - Applied patch #19 pgfkeys: ".search also" fails at unbalanced "\if" values
    - Applied patch #18 Missing grid lines with
      negative increment
    - Applied patch #17 TikZ folding library
    - Applied patch #14 inheritance in the oo module
    - Applied patch #13 leaking space in \pgfpointintersectionoflines
    - Applied patch #11 Patch for Bug #3165961 (\pgfmathmax and \pgfmathmin)

    - Applied patch #8 Support for changing physical page size with XeTeX
      (also added position saving support, while I was at it...)
    - Applied patches #3, #4, #5, #6 (typos in manual) as far as possible
    
2013-06-18 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - Fixed bug #236 "Scaled closed paths, start/end points dont exactly match":
      "cycle" can now be used with all path operations where it
      makes sense, not only with --. In particular, things like
      ".. cycle" or "to [bend right] cycle" are now allowed.

2013-05-23 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Reworked handling of edge and vertex paths in gd. In
      particular, edge--vertex intersections are now computed in
      Lua, rather than in TikZ. This is much more powerful and
      allows beautiful arcs between vertices. It is also very
      useful for planar graph drawings when several edges leave a
      vertex in the same direction.
    
2013-04-08 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - Did away with luadoc, now using simple handcoded documentor
    that will also work with Lua 5.2
    - Redid OGDF support. Resonably stable base now.
    - Added better C support.
    - Should now work with both Lua 5.1 and 5.2
    
2013-03-15 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>

    - fixed incompatibility of fixltx2e and external lib

2013-02-08 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - Reworked Storage mechanism of graph drawing system.
    - Added phylogenetics library for graph drawing; documentation
    still only rudimentary.
    
2012-12-30 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - Started adding support for calling C graph drawing functions
    from Lua.
    - First proof of concept for OGDF finished.
    - Must still address luatex shared library link problems.

2012-12-25 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - fixed bug in external lib: \tikzexternalgetnextfilename did reset the
    value of \tikzsetnextfilename and 'export next'

2012-11-30 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>

    - updated driver pgfsys-xetex: now, it supports all that the new driver
    for dvipdfmx does which includes fadings, functional shadings, and
    patterns.

2012-11-30 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - First complete documentation of the graph drawing
    system. (Finally!) 
    
2012-11-27 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Renamed gd files to shorter versions: instead of
    pgf/gd/model/pgf.gd.model.Edges.lua we now have
    pgf/gd/model/Edge.lua and so on.
    - Worked on gd documentation. Only binding doc is still a
    mess.
    
2012-11-26 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Worked on gd documentation.
    
2012-11-21 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - New version of gd lib. The internals have been completely
    redone. In particular, no tikz libraries are needed for the
    individual algorithms any longer, all declarations are now
    done completely inside Lua. This makes gd usable (in
    principle) independently of tikz and pgf.
    - Because of this, all declarations of algorithms need to be
    redone. 

2012-11-10 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - external lib: fixed spurious white space (caused by 'up to date check')

    interpolation instead of constant interpolation)

2012-09-27 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Worked on gd.
    
2012-09-26 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>
    - fixed pgfsys-pdftex.def : very old regression with \setbeamercovered{transparent}    and \pause
    Patch by Hendrik Vogt

2012-08-29 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added support for sublayouts in gd (not yet fully
    documented). This allows one to use several algorithms inside
    a single graph.
    
2012-06-28 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - Redone handling of clusters in gd yet again. Renamed them to
    "collections". Much better system now, can handle hyperedges,
    subgraphs and other stuff (in principle).
    - Nodes generated by a gd algorithm now have correct size
    information (this one was tricky!).
    
2012-06-22 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - Redone handling of clusters in gd.
    - Worked on gd documentation.

2012-06-18 Christian Feuersaenger <cfeuersaenger@users.sourceforge.net>

    directly from tex.
    
2012-05-17 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - external lib: added support for MD5/diff based up-to-date checks.
    Changes to a picture will automatically result in a remake of the
    respective external graphics.

2012-05-03 Christophe Jorssen <cjorssen@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fix bug #3527068 (\pgfmathatantwo did not exist)

2012-05-14 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

      likely to change again...
    - Added support for algorithms to create nodes and edge in the
      syntactic digraph.
    - Introduced library graphdrawing.examples that includes some
      code demonstrating how "things are done".


2012-05-13 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - context: fixed catcode issues by means of suitable module
    \protect/\unprotect statements. 

2012-05-06 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Introduced a new class model for graph drawing (Digraph,
      Arc, and Vertex instead of Graph, Edge, Node). I'm currently
      porting all the old code, but it takes a while and it's a
      bit messy right now. Some easy algorithms are already based
      on the new system, old ones not. In the end, things should
      be significantly faster and also easier to program.

2012-05-03 Christophe Jorssen <cjorssen@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Attempt to fix bug in calc lib when '!' or ':' are active (not
      fully tested but should work).

2012-05-02 Christophe Jorssen <cjorssen@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Attempt to fix bug with label and pin when ':' is active (not
      fully tested but should work).

      modules, everything is perfectly portable now.
    
2012-04-17 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Started to completely redo the module system of graph
      drawing in lua. I'm in the middle of it, so its currently
      messy, but it works.
    
2012-04-12 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Implemented packing procedure for graph drawing.
    - Cleaned up graph drawing source some more.

    - Cleaned up graph drawing algorithm directories: Moved
    obsolete algorithms to special directory.
    - Switched graph drawing calling interface from function-base
    to object-based: All graph drawing algorithms must now be
    implemented in a class
    - Cleaned up file and class names of graph drawing engine. 

2012-03-30 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed problem that in case math library is loaded before pgf
    some math functions were broken (because \pgfmath@xa and
    \pgf@xa were different registers, which they should not be).
    
2012-03-29 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added anchoring and orientation to graph drawing library. 
    
2012-03-21 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

        graph, as described in the paper.

2011-05-11 Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

    - graph drawing:
      - Fix several interpolation bugs in the coarse graph class.
      - Use the coarse graph class in the Walshaw2000 algorithm.

2011-05-11 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Worked on documentation of gd backend. Still need to
      document graph parameters.
    
2011-05-10 Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

    - graph drawing:
      - Remove files from the old graph drawing library tree.

    - Finished the graph drawing library reorganization started by Till.

2011-05-06 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Reorganized the graph drawing key and directory
      structure. The documentation is still missing. Also, lots of
      files still need to be moved, but I'll leave that to Jannis.
    
2011-05-06 Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

    - graph drawing:
      - implement a quadtree optimization in the Walshaw algorithm.
      - add a simple version of the Hu spring-electrical algorithm that
        seems to work almost as good as the Walshaw even without
          the multilevel approach implemented (which is the only thing
          that really makes the Walshaw algorithm useful).

2011-05-04 Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

    - graph drawing: 
      - Initial work on a quad tree implementation for spring and spring
          electrical algorithms, with unit test.

      - Modify the doclet to allow underscores in parameter names.
        - Document the Vector class as well as the table, iter and traversal
          helpers.

          table.merge() and table.copy() to table.custom_merge() and
          table.custom_copy() to avoid name clashes with luatools. Add 
          string helpers, including string.parse_braces(). Update algorithms 
          to work with these changes.
        - Allow vectors to have an origin vector, similar to the Position
          class. Introduce new alternative table-based syntax for
          Vector:set() that is much easier to read. Update unit tests
          and algorithms. 

2011-05-02 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - fpu: added support for log10 and log2

2011-05-02 Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

    - graph drawing: 
      - Drop the 'not yet positionedPGFGDINTERNAL' node name prefix
        internally. It's stripped off now when nodes are passed over to
          Lua and its added back again when shipping the node out to TeX.
      -    Drop the Node:shortname() method which is no longer needed.
      - Improve coding style and documentation of the Interface, Sys, 
        Node, Edge and Graph classes.

2011-05-02 Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

    - graph drawing: 
      - Initial work on spring-electrical and layered drawing algorithms.
        - Major rework of the Lua code of the graphdrawing library: added
          a Vector class for improved math operations and node positioning,
            added quite a number of table and iterator helpers, added
            post-processing code for fixing the orientation of graph drawings,
            updated the graph/node/edge data structures to store nodes in the order
            they appear instead of storing them in a random order, implement
            coordinate keys for nodes, and much more.

2011-04-30  Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - number printing: added '1000 sep in fractionals' switch

    - bugfix for rounding error in \pgfmathdivide{83.407811000}{16.68156400}
    was 4.10, is now 5.0: it could happen in rare cases that digits where 
    appended where they shouldhave been than added (4 + .10 instead of 4 + 1.0)

2011-04-22 Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

    - Implemented a G_n subgraph for creating grid (or: mesh) graphs.
    This also introduces a new key /tikz/graphs/wrap after=<number> that
    configures how the nodes in such a grid graph are connected. Some of
    the common subgraph keys such as /tikz/graphs/V and /tikz/graphs/n 
    can be used with G_n subgraphs as well.
    - Added a simple grid placement strategy. It currently does not 
    support the chain shift and group shift keys properly and does not 
    implement any placement order other than left-to-right, so there is
    room for improvement.

2011-04-18  Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - external lib: reduced number of \newwrite allocations and allowed to disable features
    to safe more of them (aux in dpth=false,disable dependency files)

    - Fix bug in pgfmathfunctions.basic.code.tex (bug reported by
    Alain Matthes and fixed by Paul Gaborit on fctt): wrong
    interaction between pow and exp (linked to \pgfmath@x modified
    outside macro call).

    - Make \pgfkeys@exp@call long (bug reported by Florent Chervet on
    fctt)
    - Fix bug in pgflibraryshapes.callouts.code.tex: \pgf@test changed
    to \pgf@node@name (bug reported by Zarko F. Cucej on ctt and fix
    contributed by Mark Wibrow)
    
2010-10-27  Christophe Jorssen <cjorssen@users.sourceforge.net>

    - added support to provide paragraphs in "pin" arguments

2010-08-24 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Worked on data visualization and its documentation.


2010-08-23 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - basic level externalization: added \hoffset=0pt and \voffset=0pt to improve
    compatibility with special document classes

    - ConTeXt support: fixed loading problem of calendar lib


2010-08-18 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - pgfsys-tex4ht.def: fixed problem with \par in a non-long macro argument,
    thereby eliminating a compilation problem
    - pgfsys-tex4ht.def: renamed offending macro invocation \Par to \par


2010-08-16 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - basic level image externalization: added '/pgf/images/trim external={<left>}{<bottom>}{<right>}{<top>}'

    \pgfpatharctoprecomputed which interpolates start- and end points
    
2010-07-10 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - external lib: fixed incompatibility with 2010/06/08 v2.0b eso-pic package 

2010-07-06 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - external lib: added sanity checking for failed \ref,\pageref,\cite commands in external images.

2010-07-01 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - math parser: improved error messages by providing the complete math expression.

2010-06-30 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - added 'trim left' and 'trim right' features to simplify bounding box
    modifications and allow support for restricted bounding boxes and image
    externalization.    

2010-06-16 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - pgfutil-latex.def: changed \usepackage to \RequirePackage (thanks to Christophe Jorssen)

2010-05-31 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Worked on data visualization.

2010-05-30 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added .list key handler.

2010-05-26 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Worked on data visualization.
    
2010-05-06 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - improved sanity checking in number printer: now, the zero flag is
    checked even if its exponent > 0

2010-04-22 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - floatparsenumber: number format errors after exponents now contain the offending
    character instead of '\relax' 

2010-04-12 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - number printer: added 'frac denom' and 'frac whole' for fine tuning of
    fractional number printing.

2010-04-10 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - number printer: made \protect portable across TeX variants (doesn't
    produce bugs with context anymore)
    - fpu: optimized \pgfmathfloatgetflagstomacro

2010-04-09 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - added \pgfresetboundingbox
    - added \pgfgetlastxy coordinate macro
    - added '/pgf/images/include external/<image name>' code key.

2010-04-08 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - fpu: added convenience method \pgfmathfloattoint

2010-03-31 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - number printer: added 'frac' style to automatically create fractionals.

2010-03-25 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - splitted basic level file pgfcoreimage.code.tex: there is now a 
    pgfcoreexternal.code.tex file.

2010-03-24 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - \pgfmathprintnumber is no longer a "fragile" command (it is \protect'ed
    automatically in LaTeX).

2010-03-23 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed baseline alignment with "text width" option in LaTeX.

2010-03-23 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - New divide function
    - Rewrote code foreach extensions. Now no longer an impenetrable mess.
      pgffor.code.tex is much larger, but contains some (as yet) undocumented 
      features which may get optimised out.
    
2010-03-19 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Image externalization: added '/pgf/images/aux in dpth' feature.
    It allows to store \label and other .aux file related stuff in the image's
    .dpth file which is processed when when the main document includes the
    image.
    The new switch is on for the semi-automatic modes of the external lib, otherwise it is
    off.

2010-03-17 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - pgfkeys: added '.code n args' handler. The difference to '.code
    args={#1#2#3}' is that keys defined with 'code n args' gobble spaces
    between the arguments.
    Note: 'code 2 args' remains as-is (it has the special feature that the
    second argument is optional).
    - fixed bug in '/.add code' key handler: it didn't work properly for
    complicated keys
    - pgfkeys manual section: updated xrefs and docs

2010-03-15 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - external lib: \tikzexternalize no longer needs (but still accepts) the
    main job's name. Changes are now documented and the replacement |.sty|
    file has been updated.
    - intersection lib: added 'name path global' feature.

2010-03-11 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - external lib: partially fixed incompatibility with glossary package and
    documented work-around

2010-03-05 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - FPU: added \pgfmathfloatifapproxequalrel 
    - number printing: added style to configure |sci precision|
    - number printing: added style to configure |std=<lower e>:<upper e>|

2010-03-03 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - external lib: the <real job's name> argument from \tikzexternalize is
    now optional. It can be deduced automatically if it is missing.

2010-02-18 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - number printing: added 'sci generic' style to customize the appearance
    of scientific format and a 'verbatim' style which doesn't use TeX macros
    for the formatted numbers.

2010-02-17 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - external lib: now, a |\jobname.auxlock| file will be generated in order
    to detect whether the \jobname.aux file is in its final state. This allows
    to export any images containing |\ref{}| manually; the automatic procedure
    will not use the .aux file.

2010-02-16 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added \ifpgfexternalreadmainaux switch. Will be used to avoid buffering
    problems during externalization mode 'convert with system call'.

2010-02-16 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed bug "papersize not supported by pgfsys-xetex.def - ID: 2934982"


2010-02-09 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Improved automatic cross referencing: auto key path prefixing failed for
    spaces in key paths.

2010-02-08 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added "on background layer" key to backgrounds lib.

2010-02-02 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - added \pgfmathifisint
    - supported \nofiles in auto xref generation

2010-02-01 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - externalization: both, basic layer and external lib now support \ref{}s
    inside of externalized pictures. Furthermore, they won't generate any aux
    files on their own (which wouldn't be thread safe and is not useful
    anyway)

2010-01-29 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - external lib: fixed bug with figure list/makefile handling and file
    deps: calling file dependency handlings outside of a picture could result
    in compilation failures

2010-01-27 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - external lib: mode=list and make now supports the force remake keys.
    - external lib: the -shell-escape switch for nested system calls is
    activated only if it was active for the main document. This should allow a
    reasonable security measure for mode=list and make (which will also work
    without system calls from within TeX).

2010-01-18 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - external lib: added support for file dependencies.
    For mode=list and make, any file dependencies configured with
    \tikzpicturedependsonfile{<name>} will be checked by the generated
    makefile.


2010-01-16 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - profiler library now uses an output file which contains the current date
    and time. Furthermore, it counts every invocation and allows to show every
    command invocation (optionally with arguments expanded).

2010-01-14 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - profiler library can now profile macros with arbitrary argument pattern
    and is more rebust with respect to save stack usage

2010-01-11 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - worked on profiler library and added docs for it.

2010-01-10 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - added first draft of the pgf 'profiler' library

2010-01-07 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fix for rounded corners affecting custom fills in rectangle 
      split shape.

2009-12-29 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - updated the 'make dist' documentation target such that it compresses
    every pdf object. The resulting manual is half as large than without
    compression, but it requires pdf 1.5 (at least acrobat 6.0).

2009-12-22 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - external lib: some output messages did not respect the 'verbose
    IO=false' flag; fixed that
    - fixed buggy treatment of some automatic cross references in manual

2009-12-15 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - external lib: improved the tikzexternal.sty package which can be used
    without pgf installed.

2009-12-04 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - added spy library.
    
2009-12-02 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - imported a patch of Andy Schlaikjer which extends the 'plot gnuplot'
    feature to read the ``unbounded point'' information provided by gnuplot.

2009-11-29 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - added \r@pgf@reada temporary \openin register for compatibility with
    other packages

2009-11-19 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - fixed an auto xref bug which wrote '\pgfkeys{}' although the manual
    contained |\pgfkeys|.

2009-11-18 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - external lib: the 'optimize command away' things where not activated
    accidentally. I fixed it.
    - added support for new paragraphs in pgfkeys values
    - fixed bug in |const plot| handler (and all its variants): the first
    coordinate was transformed twice

2009-11-15 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - auto xrefs now support point coordinate systems.
    - auto xrefs now provide an interface to deal with tricky active
    characters (for |-)
    - external lib: improved compatibility with |fadings| libary.
    - replaced 'set terminal table; set output "<file>"' by 'set table "<file>"'
    to maintain compatibility with the new gnuplot version.

2009-11-14 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - pgfmanual.pdf: provided a 'make dist' target in version_for_pdftex/en
    which activates automatic hyper references from codeexamples to key
    declarations.
    This utilizes larger memory limits, configured in
    doc/generic/pgf/text-en/texmf.cnf

2009-11-12 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added the 'small mindmap' style.

2009-11-06 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - FPU: improved sanity checks and exception handling for the decompose
    routines (pgfmathfloatgetexponent etc) and the number parser.
    Added exception 'wrong lowlevel format'.

2009-10-20 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - renamed 'text mark/style' to 'text mark style' and 'text mark/as node'
    to 'text mark as node' (there are backw. compatibility hooks).
    This should avoid confusion with '.unknown' handlers.

2009-10-19 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - improved error recovery of external lib.

2009-10-16 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - temporarily disabled the auto cross references -- it seems they compile
    only with increased memory.

2009-10-15 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Installed preliminary version of automatic cross referencing tool.
    Now, every codeexample is parsed for options and control sequences which
    have been defined somewhere else in the document; pdf cross references are
    built automatically as well.
    - configured links to be blue throughout the document.
    - external lib: added \tikzexternaldisable such that partial externalization is possible
    although the document contains unsupported constructs (where environments
    can't be identified without macro expansion).
    The pgfmanual compiles with image externalization now.

2009-10-13 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - added \pgfutilsolvetwotwoleq to solve 2x2 linear equation systems using
    column pivotisation and gauss elim. Should result in improved quality
    compared with \pgftransforminvert as internal equation solver

2009-10-09 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Defined \pgfdeclaregenericanchor to allow anchors which get the shape
    name as argument. Only useful internally.

2009-09-15 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed buggy treatment of white spaces in \jobname and 'plot function'
    using \pgfutilpreparefilename.

2009-09-04 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed bug item #2834141 [wrong reversed double arrows]
    - Fixed bug item #2834233 [shapes libraries]
    - Fixed bug item #2822265 [tangent coordinates not working in CVS]
    - Changed \rm to \tf in Context.

2009-07-31 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - external lib: added 'mode=list and make'. Now, image externalisation
    time can be reduced with 'make -j 2 -f mainfile.makefile'.

2009-07-08 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - external lib: fixed treatment of long arguments in \tikz ... ; shortcut
    command.

2009-06-30 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - fixed white space bug in \pgfkeysdeactivatefamily
    - added \pgfmathfloatvalueof

2009-06-22 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - added a '*' feature to '\pgfmathdeclarefunction' which overwrites
    existing functions.

2009-06-11 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - added '/tikz/no marks' key.
    - fixed typo in external lib documentation: the key is called 'figure name',
    not 'file name'

2009-06-10 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - added \pgfgettransformentries and \pgfsettransformentries.
    - updated the external library such that it deals with active characters
    in the same way as without external library.
    - fixed bug in fpu cosh, sinh and tanh

2009-06-09 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - provided two new aliases for key filters, added \pgfkeyssetfamily.

2009-05-29 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - allowed numbers like '.9' in fpu.

2009-02-29 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fix for signal shape. 


2009-05-22 Jin-Hwan Cho <jinhwancho@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Applied the patches for dvipdfmx driver,
    pgf-doc-diff.version2cvs (2009-04-18) and
    pgf-generic-diff.version2cvs (2009-04-19).

2009-05-18 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Restored processing of unknown keys in the predefined key filters 'and',
    'not', 'or' and 'false': it was not improvement...

2009-05-17 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - fixed the sequence of arguments of
    \pgfqkeysactivatefamiliesandfilteroptions and 
    \pgfqkeysactivatesinglefamilyandfilteroptions
    in the reference manual.

2009-05-16 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - key filtering: the composed key filter handlers 'not', 'and', 'false' and 'or' now 
    ignore unknown options and call the .unknown handlers.
    - pgfkeys: removed the experimental \pgfkeyssetdefaultpathforhandled method.
    It doesn't fit into the clean interface for pgfkeys - and the problem of
    default paths for handled keys can be solved better with the '/handler
    config' method.

2009-04-24 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - provided API function \pgfmathfloatifflags to simplify special cases in
    FPU.

2009-04-23 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - added (primitive) veclen implementation for FPU.
    - added cosh, sinh, tanh to FPU

2009-04-21 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - fixed bug in external lib: empty lines in tikzpicture environments were not accepted 
    for some operating modes.

2009-04-18 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - added \pgfqpointscale

2009-04-08 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - added an optional argument count to 'optimize command away' in external
    library.

2009-04-03 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - improved docs for externalization library

2009-03-30 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - improved sanity checking of floating point comparison: does now also
    yield results for infty/nan
    - added fix for precedence bug for unary minus (fix has been suggested by
    Mark Wibrow, by mail conversation)

2009-03-22 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Replaced \z@ by 0pt for context.

2009-03-21 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - external library: fixed the 'optimize' feature: pictures which won't be
    exported could not be optimized away (although they should)

2009-03-20 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Replaced \toks@ and \voidb@x by \pgfutil@toks@ and
      \pgfutil@voidb@x. 

2009-03-14 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - improved docs for .search also.
    - fixed initial value for 'domain' such that it really uses the default
    samples=25.
    

2009-03-09 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added patch for context color support in luatex.

2009-02-26 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - improved the optimization facilities of the external library:
    |optimize=false| will now properly restore any optimized material 
    when used in \tikzset
    
2009-02-23 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - added |/handler config=all,only existing,full or existing|
    configuration.
    - added |.search also| key handler as a simple implementation of key
    search paths.
    - fixed default value for /tikz/samples at- there are no really 25
    samples, not 26. I forgot to fix this last time when I fixed 'samples'

2009-02-20 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - added |\pgfkeyssetdefaultpathforhandled| feature as improvement for
    multiple key paths to pgfkeys. Reference documentation and an 
    application example is in the manual.

2009-02-13 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - added 'mark=text' which draws arbitrary TeX content as plot marks to
    plot mark library.

2009-02-06 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added key 'define function' to define simple local functions. 

2009-02-04 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Worked on dv stuff.
    
2009-02-01 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Index argument to array is automatically truncated to an 
      integer.
    - Text decoration can now be aligned along or fitted to a path.
    - Added key '/pgf/decoration/reverse path' to decorate a path 
      backwards.

2009-01-24 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - the FPU deactivation command is now assembled once and for all during
    its first usage.

2009-01-23 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Changed the "ellipse", "circle" and "arc" commands, so that
      they take options. This gives a much clearer and more
      flexible syntax. Naturally, the old syntax continues to work
      as expected. 
    - Documented svg stuff and added tikz interface. Most useful
      for quickly converting svg pictures to tikz pictures...

2009-01-23 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - fixed fpu 'round' method - it rounded mantissas instead of the complete
    number before.

2009-01-22 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed some math stuff
    - Renamed \pgfpathcurvebetweentime* to
      \pgfpathcurvebetweentimecontinue. 
    - Added svg.path lib. It allows one to directly use
      the svg syntax for paths (like "M10 10 L 20 20"). Not yet
      documented. 

2009-01-06 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added tutorial for mind/lecture maps.

2009-01-06 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - implemented fpu factorial
    - if the fixed point library is activated, the fpu will be deactivated
    automatically.
    - added draft for FPU documentation

2009-01-03 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - fixed bug in fpu sqrt.
    - added logical commands to fpu.
    - fixed bug in fpu related to multi-argument-commands
    - provided feature to disable fpu manually.

2008-12-31 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - added support for pgf 2.00 and the fpu (works only with additional
    and technical work - the fpu file is not all which is needed)
    - added pow and greaterthan to FPU
    - fixed some FPU issues
    - fixed processing of '/tikz/domain' key - it produced N+1 samples instead
    of N.

2008-12-30 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - added further functions to fpu; improved sanity checking; fixed smaller
    bugs related to fpu

2008-12-29 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - improved internal floating point code: it is possible to change the
      low-level representation with minimal number of code lines.
    - modified low-level floating point representation. All high level code
      should be completely unaffected; the changes are backwards compatible.
    - Wrote first draft of a floating point unit library (fpu) similar in
      spirit to the fixed point library of Mark Wibrow.
    - Moved all floating point math operations (functions) into the fpu
      library. It is now necessary to include the library in order to use
      floating point math operations. The number formatting methods are still
      available as before.

2008-12-28 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - added trigonometric functions to floating point unit.

2008-12-17 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added \colorlet to ConTeXt stuff.

2008-12-14 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Worked some more on data visualization stuff. Still in
    pre-alpha. 

2008-12-11 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - added \pgfmathfloatexp.

2008-12-07 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - floating point macros now always use the basic pgf math methods for
    mantisse computations, even if the fixed point library is active.

2008-12-06 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - 'mark=none' is now equivalent with 'mark=' (disables plot marks).
    The previous behavior was to issue \pgfuseplotmark{none} which is
    equivalent to \relax (and wastes time).

2008-12-03 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Changed exp function code in
      pgfmathfunctions.basic.code.tex. It is now *much* more
      precise for negative values and also more precise for
      positive values.

2008-11-28 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - optimized \pgfmathfloattofixed for speed (although it introduces
    redundand zeros)
    - Added '/pgf/image/include external' command key as public interface 
    to modify the '\includegraphics' command in image externalization routines.

2008-11-24 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - fixed bug with |overlay| option and matrizes: now, cell pictures won't 
    collapse any more if the matrix has |overlay| enabled. However, the
    matrix' bounding box won't contribute to the image as desired.

2008-11-23 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - added support for active '!' characters (for example in blue!30!black
    and french babel setting)
    - modified processing of 'domain' option: the argument is '\edef'ed such
    that any potentially active ':' characters will be expanded to non-active
    ones (avoiding errors in the following processing).

2008-11-13 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed \pgfnodealias bug that caused chains to fail in matrices.

2008-10-30 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added shading library, mainly containing the new color wheel
    shading donated by Ken Starks.

2008-10-27 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - More fixes for insertion of spaces.

2008-10-27 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added square arrow send by
      gvtjongahung@users.sourceforge.net.
    - Changed pgfutil-context.def so that driver detection should
      work once more.

2008-10-27 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed insertion of space when parsing exponents.

2008-10-23 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - added int truncation to floating point unit.

2008-10-22 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - added abs, abserror and relerror to floating point unit.

2008-10-21 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - added sqrt for floating point unit, built on top of pgfmathsqrt.

2008-10-09 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed the wrong lengths of support vectors for circles. Used to
      be 0.555 (found by trial and error), while the correct value
      is 4/3*(sqrt(2)-1) = 0.5522847, which gives much better
      circles.
      Thanks to Ken Starks for point this out.

2008-10-07 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed rounded rectangle right arc bug.

2008-10-06 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed missing treatment of 'assume math mode' in \pgfmathprintnumber'

2008-10-05 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed missing switching off of auto anchors in positioning
      library. 

2008-10-01 Till Tantau <tantau@tcs.uni-luebeck.de>

    - Fixed matrix/pdfsync incompatibility.

2008-09-30 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed some parsing bugs with arrays.
    - Fix for parsing of arrays in TikZ coordinates. 

2008-09-25 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added number formatting option 'min exponent for 1000 sep'.

2008-09-21 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed bug in math parser which inserted spaces into text
      or picture.

2008-09-17 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - added number formatting style 'sci superscript'
    Example: formats the number 42 as 4.2^1 instead of 4.2 \cdot 10^1

2008-09-15 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed bug "TikZ, the shadow library and ConTeXt MKIV
      (LuaTeX)". 
    
2008-09-14 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed bug #2105132 for rounded rectangle.
    - Fixed bug #2044129 for chamfered rectangle.
    
2008-09-12 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added \pgfpathcurvebetweentime.

2008-09-10 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed problem with nodes on a line inside a picture that is
      inside a node of another picture. Pictures will now always
      start with "pos=.5" set.

2008-09-07 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Slight hack of decorations so that the input path can consist of a
      single move to. This enables stuff like 
      \path [decoration={some decoration}, decorate] (4,5);

2008-09-03 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - fixed small bug related to '@dec sep mark' and not-a-number in number
    formatting routines.

2008-09-03 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Solutions for path intersections can now be sorted along either path.
    - \pgfintersectionsolutions is now a macro, not a count register.

2008-08-31 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - fix for ``Missing character...' warnings in logfile when using 
      foreach.
    - removed `trim integers' option from foreach as int function 
      can now be used.

2008-08-31 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Rewrote math parser. Anyone who relies on, or has hacked internal 
      parser or function macros, or has defined their own functions for
      the parser will need to reconsult the code and/or documentation. 
    - Files for functions definitions split (possibly permanantly) into 
      different files.
    - Scaling of results at the end of the parse is no longer the default 
      action. This doesn't break PGF or TikZ, but it may break user code
      that depended on this scaling. To turn it back on use 
      \let\pgfmathpostparse=\pgfmathscaleresult. 
    - Modifying existing functions or creating new functions must now be
      done using \pgfmathdeclarefunction and \pgfmathredeclarefunction.
    - Single argument functions do not need parentheses, provided the
      funtion is followed by a space, so sin 60 is the same as sin(60).
      But! Functions have the highest precedence, so sin 60*\x is the 
      same as sin(60)*\x.
    - Added {} operators for array specification and [] operators for 
      array access - see docs for details.
    - added postfix ! factorial operator.
    - added c++/java style conditional e.g., \x > 10 ? 13 : 20.
    - added >=, <=, !=, prefix !, &&, || operators.
    - added atan2, log10, log2, e, int and frac functions.
    - adapted cosh, sinh and tanh from Martin Heller.
    - added lua-style random function for generating random integers.
    - added Mod function (note capital letter). Uses floored division
      and is never negative.
    - min, max, veclen and pow can now be nested in any argument 
      position.
    - min and max can now take a variable number of arguments.
    - For compatability \pgfmathmax and \pgfmathmin still take two 
      arguments (although these can contain comma separated expressions). 
      However \pgfmathmin@ and \pgfmathmax@ now only take
      one argument in the form \pgfmathmin@{{1}{2}{3}{4}{5}} (for 5 
      arguments).
    - added hex, Hex, bin, and oct functions. These functions will not
        work properly if the post-parse scaling is turned back on.
    - 0 prefix for integers now specifies an octal number which is 
      automatically converted to base 10.
    - 0x or 0X prefix for integers now specifies a hexadecimal number, 
      which is automatically converted to base 10. 
    - 0b or 0B prefix for integers now specifies a binary number, 
      which is automatically converted to base 10.
    - "" characters turn off parsing (!) for part of an expression.
    - added width, height, and depth functions for text e.g., 
      width("Some text"), but as an expression is \edef'ed before
      parsing other commands will have to be `protected' e.g.,
      width("\noexpand\Huge Some text").
    - bugfix for tan and cot. 

2008-08-27 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - added '/tikz/external/export={true,false}' key for externalization
    library.

2008-08-05 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - added documentation for basic layer externalization and baseline option.

2008-07-28 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - added 'showpos' key to number printing (and alias 'print sign').

2008-07-22 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - fixed typo in pgfmathfloat.code.tex
    - added 'optimize command away=\macro' key to externalization library. It
    allows to discard unnecessary and possibly expensive user macros during
    export (unnecessary = not in selected picture).

2008-07-18 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed bug in system layer path collecting. Very long paths
    are now processed more efficiently (the bug disabled an optimization).

2008-07-14 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - added "marker" positions into the output of number formatting routines
    to find period positions (even if no period is typeset) and exponent
    positions. Allows alignment within auxiliary routines.

2008-07-14 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed dash phase bug.
    - Fixed missing library include in automata lib.
    - Added "align" option. "text ragged" and friends are now
      deprecated. Text width need no longer not, but can, be
      specified. The following now has the expected effect: \node
      [draw,align=center] {Hello\\world.}; 

2008-07-10 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - added \pgfqpointxy and \pgfqpointxyz to complement the "quick" point
    commands in basic layer.

2008-07-09 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - added 'every mark' style.
    - 'mark options' simply overwrites 'every mark' (consistent with its old
    definition)

2008-07-07 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Finished circuit library and documentation (well, some
      shapes still missing, but that's something users should
      contribute). 

2008-07-01 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - the external library now handles active double quotes ",
      single quotes ', and active semicolons ';' in its system call
      correctly. Furthermore, \\ will expand to a normal
      backslash. The initial system call now uses double quotes
      for indows compatibility, it also contains the shell-escape
      feature for gnuplot invocations.

2008-06-30 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Did some documentation of circuit lib.
    - Removed the separated documentation of the intersection
      library and made this documentation part of the main
      documentation. 
    - The intersection cs is now deprecated, the documentation
      is now only based on the intersection lib. 
    - Added a "by" option so that "name intersections={of=A and
      B,by={c,d,e}}" will create an alias c for intersection-1, d
      for intersection-2 and e for intersection-3.
    - Renamed "path name" to "name path" in the intersection
      lib. This is more consistent with "name intersections".

2008-06-29 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Minor changes on float stuff, wrote pgfmathfloatmultiply and
      pgfmathfloatdivide on top of pgfmathmultiply and pgfmathdivide

2008-06-29 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added `Fixed Point Arithmetic' library, which provides
      a parsing interface to the fp package. Dealing with plotting
      files still a bit crude. 
    - This library means the manual now requires the fp pacakge 
      to compile.
    - Fixed floor function for negative numbers.
    - Fixed \pgfmathsetseed.
    - Font and group fix for external documentation.

2008-06-27 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Complete change of TikZ intersections (PGF unchanged).
    - Slight hack of the TikZ scopes library to permit local
      path naming. Should work...
    
2008-06-26 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Continued with circuit library.
    - Introduced subdirectories inside the pgf library
      directory and moved libs into them.
      You may need to update your checkout.

2008-06-26 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - The external library now typesets as horizontal material by issueing
      \leavevmode. This fixes an inconsistency with the normal tikzpictures.

2008-06-25 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added intersection library + documentation for 
      intersecting ``named'' paths.
  
2008-06-25 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed bug in external library. Now, strings like '#1' occuring 
      somewhere in an image is collected correctly.

2008-06-24 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Removed new intersection stuff. Need to restart from scratch...

2008-06-23 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Started working on circuit library documentation.

2008-06-23 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added PGF code and docs for intersections of two curves and 
      intersections of a line and a curve.
    - Fixed bug in foreach code when registers are used with dots
      statement.
              
2008-06-22 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Created first version of circuit libraries for electrical
      engineering (circuits.ee.*). 
    - Added libraries so that ee circuits and logical circuits can
      be accessed using the same interface. (circuits.logic.*)
    - The tikz lib shapes.gates.logic.* will no
      longer be needed, the circuits.logic.* will replace them. (The
      pgf libs shapes.gates.* are still used as before, however.)
    - Minor patch in shapes.gates.logic.US so that the .0 and .180
      anchors of a not gate or a buffer gate are the same as the
      input or output anchors.
    - All this is not documented, yet.
    - Worked some more on dv stuff, but nothing to "show", yet.

2008-06-21 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed parsing bug in foreach code.
    - Added "rotate fit" key to fit library, so (e.g.) a rotated 
      rectangle can be fitted around nodes/coordinates.

2008-06-21 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added documentation for tikz 'external' library.
    - created pgfexternalwithdepth.tex file to use the 'baseline' information.
    - improved some issues of the external library.
    - Added '/pgf/images/draft' option
    - Modified implementation of draft images to show the image file name
    instead of the internal image name

2008-06-19 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added tikz library 'external' which allows automatic or semiautomatic 
      export of each tikzpicture to pdf. Documentation is not yet ready.
    - Added self-contained latex package tikzexternal.sty to read those images
      without tikz/pgf installed.
    - Added support for the 'baseline' option in \beginpgfgraphicnamed ... \endpgfgraphicnamed
      by storing the box depth into a separate file.

2008-06-19 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added first ideas for a circuit library.
    - Bugfixes in scoping behaviour.
    - Changed scoping rules for to path operation: Options are now
      local. This may break existing code, but is much more
      consistent with everything else and removes other problems. 
    - Patched mindmap lib to account for these changed rules.
    - Added insert path option.
    - Deprecated "after node path". Use "append after command" and
      "prefix after command" instead.
    - Moved datavisualization libraries to separate subdirectory.

2008-06-18 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Changed label and pin options once again, to allow more
      flexibility. In particular, the angle can now be
      omitted. Also, for rotated main nodes the anchors are now
      chosen in more sensible ways.

2008-06-16 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added tiny little turtle graphics library for fun.
    - Changed scoping rules for \foreach statement on a path: the
      last coordinate is now persistent not only after the foreach
      statement, but also between different iterations.
    - Changed positioning of "label" when you attach a label to a
      transformed shape. The position is now absolute with respect
      to the page, unless the "transform shape" option is used.
    
2008-06-11 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed the bug fix for character checking in foreach.
    - Updates and fixes for new foreach code.

2008-06-13 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed bug in new \foreach stuff that causes an error on
      things like \foreach \i in {1,...,\foo}. If a list element
      is a macro, no is-it-a-character check is done.

2008-06-11 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Checked in proposed \foreach extensions. Possibly the
      extensions would be better contained in a pgflibrary...
    - list items can now be evaluated.
    - dots replacement is context sensitive.
    - sequences indicated by dots can be character sequences.
    - a list item can be ``remembered'' in the next iteration.
    - access to the number of the current item in the list is
      provided. 

2008-06-09 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Worked a bit on data visualization stuff.
    
2008-06-07 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added '/pgf/number format/1000 sep' and 'dec sep' shortcut 
      styles which simply call 'set thousands separator' and 'set 
      decimal separator'. Those option are somewhat long...

2008-06-06 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed the "local bounding box" option so that it honors the
      "relevant for picture size"-if.
    
2008-06-04 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed buggy "mid left" and "mid right" options.
    - Added "between positions" option to the "mark" option. This
      makes it possible to create paths with "repeated arrows along
      the path". This did not work before.

2008-06-03 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added '/pgf/number format/assume math mode' to disable math checks. 
      This allows to assemble tabulars, apply \pgfmathprintnumber to each cell
      and use the dcolumn package to align at decimal separators (no
      documentation for that feature yet)

2008-06-02 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed pgfpages in conjunction with everyshi.

2008-05-31 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - Semantics of |/pgf/number format/fixed zerofill| changed: it now simply
      sets a boolean which affects all numbers in fixed format; it does not
      SET fixed format. The same holds for sci zerofill.

2008-05-30 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Provided \pgfmathprintnumberto macro in addition to
      \pgfmathprintnumber.

2008-05-22 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

      interfaces.
    - Modified pgf manual macros: codeexamples section now employs pgfkeys,
      xkeyval no longer required. Introduced style 'every codeexample' to
      maintain compatibility and allow customization for users.

2008-05-21 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added missing documentation of moveto-decoration.

2008-05-20 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Changed the processing of \pgflsystemstep. Now a TeX
      dimension, it permits a symbol to shorten the step.

    - Added documentation for zero level streams.

2008-05-15 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added "path picture" option, mostly for the implementation
      of the corrected mindmap connecting bars.
    - Fixed buggy code of mindmap connect bars: Shading angles
      where sometimes wrong and shading was sometimes at the wrong
      position.  

2008-05-14 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Completely rewrote management of pdf resources. This affects
      pdftex, dvipdfm, dvipdfmx and xetex backends and all front
      ends. They should now all work together in harmony, as far
      as this is supported by them.
    - Completely rewrote driver detection in plain and context
      mode. 
    - dvipdfmx and xetex now use \special{pdf:literal direct},
      which can *considerably* reduce file sizes (up to a factor
      of 2).

2008-05-14 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed compatability issue with old calc code.
    
2008-05-13 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - documented '.lasttry' key handler
    - introduced documentation for key filtering routines (as \input section
    in pgfmanual-en-pgfkeys.tex). Main section of pgfkeys not really updated

        /pgf/number format/set decimal separator
        /pgf/number format/set thousands separator
        /pgf/number format/skip 0.
    - Added documentation for floating point arithmetics
    - Added documentation for number printing

2008-04-26 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added PGF plot handlers to plot handler library:
        - \pgfplothandlerxbar

    - Made some arrow tips work with double lines.

2008-04-22 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added (not yet documented) "inner lines", which move the
      double line mechanism from tikz to the basic layer. This
      allows the definition of special arrow tips for double lines.
    - Added (not yet documented) new arrow tip "implies" using
      this mechanism.

2008-04-21 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - New version of rectangle split shape. Now supports horizontal
      as well as vertical spliting. Also supports up to 20 parts. 

2008-04-17 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added pgfkeysfiltered.code.tex which provides key filtering
      and provides key-selection utilities like xkeyvals families
    - changed pgfkeys.code.tex to '\input' pgfkeysfiltered.code.tex

2008-04-14 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added \tikzaddtikzonlycommandshortcutlet and

2008-04-03 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - Switched to everyshi in latex mode to hack into
      \shipout. Wrote direct code to hack into \shipout in plain
      mode. Hacking into \shipout in Context is still unclear.
    - Added space arrow.
    
2008-4-02 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - Reimplemented parsing of operands. 

2008-04-01 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added cirlce solidus shape by Manuel Lacruz.

2008-03-19 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - `curve control points' decoration no longer exists. It is 
      replaced by the `show path construction' decoration.
    - added code + docs for defining changable patterns.
    - Parser altered to access \pgfmathfloatparsenumber when 
      \ifpgfmathfloat is true (old interface to \pgfmathfloat deleted).

    - Added generic/pgf/math/pgfmathfloat.code.tex
    - Modified pgfmath.code.tex to include pgfmathfloat.code.tex
    - Added generic/pgf/testsuite/mathtest/pgfmathtestsuite.tex [dvipdfm/pdflatex]
      which provides testing for pgfmathfloat.code.tex

2008-03-17 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed minimum width handling in rounded rectangle shape. 

2008-03-12 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added key for rectangle split to ignore empty parts.
    - Extended \pgfshadecolortorgb to define macros for the
      individual color components.

2008-03-08 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added `curve control points' decoration for drawing
      curve controls. NB: names/keys may change.

2008-03-07 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fix for (some) `hidden' bugs: ``Missing character: 
      There is no <char> in font nullfont!''. This is usually
      only seen in log file. Fixed for star, circular sector
      and math macros.

2008-03-03 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed documentation "placment" replaced by "positioning"
    - Fixed ConTeXt page resource problem. (ConTeXt support is
      still not as smooth as support of other formats)
    - Checked in some data visualization stuff, without any
      documentation. Everything still likely to change
      completely. 
    - Moved module management to pgfutil.
    - Added support for simple oo-programming, not documented. 

2008-02-26 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed bug in pgfkeysaddvalue.
    - Fixed bug of stack leak in function shadings in postscript.
    - Fixed missing image inclusion documentation.
    - Fixed atan bug in documentation example.
    - Fixed missing dependency of chains--positioning library
    - Fixed missing dependency of mindmap--decorations library

2008-02-20 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    Released version 2.00

2008-02-14 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed "initial"/"accepting" distance bug.
    - Fixed wrong intersection computation bug.
    
2008-02-13 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added "local bounding box" option for Fabien...

2008-02-12 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Finished chains and chain tutorial.
    - Fixed height of rounded rectangle shape.
    
2008-02-11 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added "auto end on length" and "auto corner on length"
      options to decorations.
    - Added "if input segment is closepath" option to
      decorations. 
    - Renamed "subpath" in decoration code to "inputsegment". In
      the pdf-specification (and in the rest of the pgf manual) a
      path is made up of subpath, which are started by movetos,
      and these in turn are made up of segments. In decorations,
      segments used to be called subpaths, which was too
      confusing... 
    - More renaming in chains, but its stabilizing now.
    - Started a tutorial on chains.
    
2008-02-10 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Moved chain part inside "positioning" into "chains"
      library. 
    - Renamed things in the chains library, yet again and added
      branches.
    - Fixed bug with "xyz of" placements.

2008-02-08 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Renamed "placements" library to "positioning".
    - Renamed and changed all chain commands.
    - Added scopes library.
    - Renamed cap and join to line cap and line join (but old ones
      are still available).

2008-02-07 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Patched Makefiles according to suggestion by Hans Meine.
    - Fixed bug: duplicate fading name in pgflibraryfadings.
    - Fixed bug: wrong size of functional shading in dvips.
    - Fixed bud: documentation a4paper setting.
    - Fixed bug: Manual now compiles with tex4ht once more.
    - Fixed bug: Manual now is hyperlinked also for dvipdfm.
    - Fixed bug: wrong size of all shadings in svg code.
    - Slight change in placement lib, default chain now has a
      name. 

2008-02-07 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Removed internal asin tables as asin is now calculated from 
      acos tables.
    - Misc. updates for shapes docs.


2008-02-06 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Changed fit library, so that nodes are now "completely"
      fitted. 
    - Changed tutorial so that fit library is now used.
    - Added placement library and documentation.

2008-02-05 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixes in snake compatibility code.
    - Added dvipdfmx support (identical to dvipdfm).
    - Fixed missing braces and color stack problem in
      shapes.logic.IEC. 

2008-02-04 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Patched (and hopefully fixed) hyperref support.
    - Made matrix inversion more precise.
    - Added tutorial for geometric constructions.
    - Fixed partway and intersection computations.
    - Added line to circle intersection.

2008-02-03 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - Added through library (still very simple...).
    - Added computation of intersection of circles and tangent to
      a circle.

2008-01-31 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Updated isosceles triangle shape. Positioning of node
      contents improved. Added key so minimum width and height
      can be applied independently
    - Fix for trapezium shape for minimum height. This fix may
      ``break'' exisiting code by making any trapezium enlarged using
      minimum height to appear slightly wider than before. But...
    - Added keys for trapezium so that minimum width and height
      can be applied independently, or to just the `body' of the
      trapezium. 

2008-01-30 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Reimplemented shape `tape'. Anchors should behave a bit
      better now.

2008-01-29 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed problem with pin a relative coordinates.

2008-01-27 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added `logic gate IEC symbol color` key to change color
      for all symbols simultaneously.
    - Fix for loading US and IEC shape library separately.
    - Misc. updates for decoration docs.

2008-01-26 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Modified calc library. Working on documentation.
    - Added calc library and ($...$) notation for coordinates.

2008-01-25 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - Reorganised logic shapes. Now two libraries:
      shapes.gates.logic.US (for `American' gates) and 
      shapes.gates.logic.IEC (for rectangular gates).
      Gates are now named `and gate US' or `and gate IEC' etc.
      TikZ key `use US style logic gates' and `use IEC style
      logic gates' set up styles so that (e.g.) `and gate' 
      becomes a synonym for `shape=and gate US'. See docs for
      details.

2008-01-23 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added decorations.markings.

2008-01-22 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed pgfpatharc: Fractional angles are now handled
      correctly. 
    - Fixed incompatability with bm package: Changed hack to
      \@@end to \AtEndDocument.
    - Changed things in the math engine to speed up things: First,
      \pgfmath@returnone now uses simpler and faster code. Second,
      some marshals in the internal math commands like
      \pgfmathadd@ have been removed. This makes it necessary that
      the second operand in a call to an internal math macro no
      longer uses \pgf@x or \pgf@xa and I fixed the 3 places where
      this was the case.
    - Added footprint decoration and merged Marks footprints.
    - Added buffering to the subpath mechanism. This speeds up
      constructions of very long paths by a factor of 10 or more. 
    - Fixed missing declaration of \iftikz@decoratepath in
      tikz.code.tex. 

2008-01-22 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - Added logic shapes library. Includes AND gate, NAND gate,
      OR gate, NOR gate, XOR gate, XNOR gate and NOT gate.

2008-01-22 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fooled around with title page.
    - Changed TikZ path scoping rules: Scopes no longer affect the
      last point on a path. This was a nuiseance before and became
      a real problem with decorations.
    - Finished my move from snakes to decorations. Also finished
      documentation. 
      We are now ready for a new release!
    
2008-01-19 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - Removed \externalcode command for decoration states as
      persistent pre/postcomputation stuff does a similar job.      

2008-01-18 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - Added \externalcode command for decoration states. Allows
      code to be executed outside the TeX-group the state code
      is executed in.

2008-01-17 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Split decoration lib into several libs. 
    - Renamed lineto decoration to curveto decoration.
    - Renamed many keys of decorations and snakes to shorter
      names.
    - Changed the tikz setting of decoration options.
    - No documentation yet.

2008-01-17 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Started merging snakes and decorations. Not yet finished.

2008-01-16 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - (Partly) rewrote the tikz support for decorations. There is
      now a "decorate" path command:
      \draw ... decorate [decoration=zigzag] { (0,0) -- (1,2) };
          This yields a much cleaner interface.
    - There is also a decorate=true/false option that causes the
      whole path to be decorated.
    - Decorated path can now contain nodes.
    - Node paths can also be decorated now.
    - Fixed missing \pgftransformreset inside decoration
      environment. 
    
2008-01-15 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Changed the decoration documentation a bit. Still not quite
        perfect... 
    - Restructured the basic layer. There is a central core (which
      got slightly larger) and "modules", which can be included
      using \usepgfmodule. All the pgfbaseXXX files are now
      obsolete and only included for the old ones for
      compatibility.
      The {pgf} package no longer includes the modules "pattern",
      "snakes" and "decorations" by default. However, these
      modules are loaded by their respective libraries, so,
      normally, no one will notice.    
    
2008-01-15 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - Fix for minimum size in ellipse split shape.
    - Added decorations documentation.

2008-01-14 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Coordinates like (2,3cm) are now allowed. Has the same
      effect as ([shift={(2,0)}]0pt,3cm), which is what everybody
      would expect.
    - Moved tikz hacks inside tikzlibrarydecorations into
      tikz.code.tex itself.

2008-01-14 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - Fix for save stack overflow in decorations.
    - Renamed \pgfdecorate \endpgfdecorate, now \pgfdecoration
      \endpgfdecoration. Makes it more consistent with...
    - Meta decorations! Automata that decorate the path with
      decoration automata! Increased fancyness! Docs soon.
    - Removed a bunch of keys from \tikzlibrarydecorations as
      not really necessary.    

2008-01-13 Till tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Changed shadow lib once more and added it to CVS.

2008-01-13 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added decorations files. Docs to follow soon(ish).
    - Fix for `star point ratio' and `star point height'
      keys in star shape.

    - Added copy shadow.

2008-01-10 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added random steps snake.
    
2008-01-09 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

      needed).
    - Added preaction and postaction options (very useful).
    - Added transform canvas option.
    - Added scale around option.
    - Moved tikz.code.tex to tikz/tikz.code.tex
    - Moved .../libraries/pgflibrarytikzXXXX.code.tex to
      .../frontendlayer/tikz/libraries/tikzlibraryXXXX.code.tex.

2007-12-20 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed missing example bbs for dvipdfm.
    - Fixed buggy swirl shading.
    - Finished documentation switch from \itemoption to {key}.

    - Added `ellipse split' shape.

2007-12-17 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed spaces problem with external graphics.
    - Added [missing] option to supress children.
    - Reduced number of libs includes by {shapes} to geometric,
      misc and symbol. Shapes is now more or less deprecated.

2007-12-13 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Added fadings.
    - Added functional shadings.
    - Fixed bug in double drawing with arrows.

2007-11-24 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fix for all math functions with two arguments.
    - Fix for tikz when y-coordinate is a function within braces.
    - Fix for distance calculation in shape snake.
    - Added `cloud callout' shape.
    - cloud shape can now use (or ignore) `aspect' key.
    - More key updates/fixes for shapes.
    
2007-11-23 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - Corrected minimum size of a diamond shape (was twice the
      correct size -- this may break existing code, but that cannot
      be avoided!).
    - Changed some more documentation from \itemoption to {key}s. Not
       yet finished.
    
2007-11-19 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Updated math documentation. Code examples now consistent with
      the rest of the manual.

2007-11-12 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - Fixed hyperref-dvipdfm-problem.
    
2007-11-10 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Updated cloud shape for minimum size calculations.
    - Reimplemented rounded rectangle. Now supports concave arcs.
    - Removed all stuff for Fancy hyperlinked picture of shapes.

2007-11-07 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    - \foreach will now allow a macro name to be given as list
      argument (as in \foreach \x in \mylist {...})
    
2007-10-29 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed keys problem when .try is used with a comma.
    
2007-10-28 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

    - Fixed shape snake for drawing to other pictures.
