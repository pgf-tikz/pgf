% Support of object-oriented programming in TeX.


% The oo support works as follows:
%
% The main supported concepts are classes, objects, methods,
% attributes and signal/slots. A class defines a set of methods, which are,
% in the end, just normal TeX macros. Once a class has been created,
% it can be instantiated by calling the \pgfoonew command, resulting
% in a new object. Objects are local to their group. Given an object,
% you can send it a message, resulting in the method code of the
% object's method to be executed. While an object exists, it has a set
% of attributes whose values can change over time. Attributes values
% are not local to TeX groups, rather their life-cycle is the same as
% the object's (which, however, is local to the group in which the
% object was declared).
%
% The implementation is as follows: There is an ID counter that is
% increased each time an object is created. This counter is local to
% the group, which means that when a group ends the counter will
% revert to the previous value, allowing objects to the reused in
% subsequent groups.
%
% A method is just a normal \TeX macro, but to call it you write
% \objecthandle.methodname(parameters). The \objecthandle is a macro
% that is created when you say \pgfoonew. The special object
% \pgfoothis is the current object.
%
% Attributes are stored globally in internal TeX macros whose name is
% composed of the object number and the attribute name.
%
% A signal must first be initialized. Then it can be emitted. Methods
% of objects (called slots in this case) can tune in to signals,
% in this case whenever the signal is raised, a method of the object is
% invoked.



% Declares a class
%
% #1 = class name
% #2 = methods
%
% Description:
%
% This command declares a class for futurue use. Inside #2, the macro
% \method can be used to declare a method. The \method macro takes a
% method name, parameters (methods are normal TeX macros, after all)
% and body.

% Declare a method
%
% Description:
%
% Defines a method. To use/invoke this method for an object \object,
% you write \object.methodname(parameters). This will cause the method
% body to be invoked with the argument "(parameters)".
%
% To define the method \method should be directly followed by the
% method name and, then, by (, followed by a parameter pattern,
% followed by ), followed by the message body. Spaces are allowed only
% after "\method" and after the closing ).
%
% Example:
%
% \pgfooclass{MyPlot}{
%
%   \method MyPlot() {
%     \pgfooset{x}{0}
%     \pgfooset{y}{0}
%   }
