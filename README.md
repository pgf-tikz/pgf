# pgf â€“ A Portable Graphic Format for TeX

![CI](https://github.com/pgf-tikz/pgf/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

PGF is a TeX macro package for generating graphics. It is platform-
and format-independent and works together with the most important TeX
backend drivers, including `pdftex` and `dvips`. It comes with a
user-friendly syntax layer called Ti*k*Z.

See the directory `doc/generic/pgf` for more information. See the file
`doc/generic/pgf/pgfmanual.pdf` (also available from
https://pgf-tikz.github.io/pgf/pgfmanual.pdf) for a manual. This
documentation also explains the installation.  See the file
`doc/generic/pgf/license/LICENSE` for license details.

Please go to the official repository at https://github.com/pgf-tikz/pgf or the
official mailing list at https://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/pgf-tikz to submit
bug reports, request new features, etc.

We also have a chat on the Matrix network at
[#pgf-tikz:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#pgf-tikz:matrix.org).

## Installation

In general you should just use the version of PGF that is shipped by
your TeX distribution.  See their documentation on how to install
packages.

If you are feeling adventurous you can install the latest development
version in TeX Live from our tlcontrib repository.
```console
$ tlmgr repository add http://pgf-tikz.github.io/pgf/tlnet pgf-development
$ tlmgr pinning add pgf-development "*"
$ tlmgr update --self --all
$ tlmgr install pgf --reinstall
```

## Development

Currently PGF does not have a comprehensive test suite to check for
regressions, so for now we check for bugs by building the manual for
each commit. This can be achieved from the Terminal/Command prompt
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/pgf-tikz/pgf
$ cd pgf
$ l3build doc
```
on a system which has Git and an up-to-date TeX system installed.

A small number of tests can be run using
```console
$ l3build check
```
